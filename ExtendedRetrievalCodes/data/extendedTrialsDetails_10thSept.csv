Inferior turbinates can swell up and block the breathing passage, making~     it hard to breath. To address this, turbinate size must be reduced.~      This study looks at two common procedures for turbinate reduction:~        1. Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) involves inserting a special needle into the inferior~          (lower) turbinate that releases thermal energy, which significantly reduces its size.~          This can be done under local anesthesia at the doctor's office.~        2. Partial Resection of Inferior Turbinate (PRIT) involves surgically removing a piece off~          the turbinate, which also reduces its size.~      While both procedures improve nasal obstruction, no study has directly compared which is more~     effective.~      Eighty patients being treated for septal deformity and turbinate hypertrophy will be randomly~     chosen for either PRIT or RFA treatment. They will fill out a simple, five question survey~     that measures how they view their nasal blockage 4 times in one year.

It is supposed that the cocoa polyphenols represent the active principle,~     lowering BP by increasing the formation of vasodilative nitric oxide. However, direct~     evidence for this assumption from controlled clinical studies is lacking. Moreover, in~     hypertensive subjects vascular dilation appears to be impaired due to endothelial dysfunction~     and vascular smooth muscle remodeling, but it is unclear whether the BP response to cocoa~     phenols differs between subjects with high blood pressure and optimal blood pressure.~      The investigators hypothesized that (1) intake of cocoa phenols cause a dose-dependent, acute~     elevation of circulating bioactive NO levels and a reduction in BP, and that (2) the NO~     elevation and BP reduction are impaired in patients with hypertension.~      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized,~     placebo-controlled, double-blind, sample size-calculated, three-period crossover study with~     pre-planned statistical analysis and trial monitoring, in which cocoa phenols will be orally~     administered to subjects with mild essential hypertension or subjects with optimal blood~     pressure. The effects on blood pressure, heart rate, arterial function and plasma levels of~     cocoa phenols, circulating bioactive nitric oxide, and plasma markers of oxidative stress~     will be evaluated. After a 7-day cocoa-free run-in period and a 12-hour overnight fast, 48~     subjects (24 with hypertension and 24 sex-, and age (+/- 2yrs)-matched subjects with optimal~     blood pressure) will receive either a single dose of 1000 mg cocoa polyphenols, 250 mg cocoa~     phenols or placebo (in capsules of equal form and weight). Each intervention will be followed~     by a 7-day cocoa-free washout period before cross-over to the subsequent intervention.~     Subjects will be allocated to the intervention sequence by permuted block randomization (i.e.~     permuted blocks of 2 subjects with high BP and 2 subjects with optimal BP each, are assigned~     to permutations of the tree interventions).

"NCT00709137","treating people already having hypertension_page_rank.csv","Spironolactone Versus Amiloride as an Add on Agent in Resistant Hypertension","~     Joint National Committee 7 (JNC-7) defines resistant hypertension as a persistent elevation~     of blood pressure (BP) above goal - ≥ 140/90 mm Hg for the general hypertensive population or~     ≥ 130/80 mm Hg for persons with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease - for at least~     three months despite treatment with three or more optimally dosed antihypertensive agents,~     including a diuretic. The exact prevalence of resistant hypertension is uncertain but may~     include 5-20% of hypertensive persons in primary care settings and 15-35% of the older,~     higher cardiovascular risk hypertensive patients incorporated into recent clinical trials of~     antihypertensive therapy. Observational studies demonstrate that patients with resistant~     hypertension experience a higher rate of cardiovascular and renal target organ damage such as~     left ventricular hypertrophy, microalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency and more~     cardiovascular disease (CVD) events than patients whose hypertension is well-controlled.~     Additionally, resistant hypertension patients may be subjected to the considerable expense of~     multiple office visits, diagnostic testing for secondary causes of hypertension, and referral~     to hypertension specialists. Because multiple factors can contribute to resistant~     hypertension, an explicit, sequential approach to evaluation and management is essential to~     optimize blood pressure, reduce cardiorenal morbidity and mortality, and avoid unnecessary~     expense. A number of observational studies have suggested the potential efficacy of both~     spironolactone and amiloride when added to a 3 drug antihypertensive regimen, but to date no~     randomized study has directly compared the two agents. The goal of this study is to determine~     whether spironolactone or amiloride is the more effective fourth agent to add to a three drug~     regimen in patients with resistant hypertension.~   ","C0037982;C0020538","C0149721;C1565489;C0011849;C0730345;C0005823;C3887460;C3887460;C3887460;C0005823;C0037982;C0037982;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0596545;C0220825;C0012634;C0012634;C0022646;C0178784;C0003364;C0020538;C0086143;C0087130;C0376495",0,0

The low~     dose TA group is: 10 mg/kg TA given over 15 min, followed by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/h~     throughout the operation, and 1 mg/kg into the CPB prime volume. The high dose group is :30~     mg/kg TA given over 15 min, followed by an infusion of 16 mg/kg/h throughout the operation,~     and 2 mg/kg into the CPB prime volume. Hemodynamic and anaesthesia care will be as usual. A~     blood salvage device will be systematically used. The triggers for transfusion will be: red~     blood cells: haemoglobin less than 8 g/dl or 6 g/dl during CBP; Plasma: PT less than 50% or~     INR more than 1.5; platelets: platelets count less than 50/70 G/mm3; fibrinogen: fibrinogen~     less than 1g/l . All patients will receive standard anaesthesia and perioperative care.~      In 60 consecutive patients in the principal investigator center, 5 blood samples will allow~     to assess the plasmatic concentration of tranexamic acid at different time of the surgery~     procedure:~        1.

Analysis will be in intention to treat. 300 patients should be recruited in each~     group to detect an absolute difference of respectively 10% (low risk cardiac surgery) and 20%~     (high risk cardiac surgery) in the number of patients exposed to allogenic blood transfusion~     between patients receiving high dose TA regimen and those receiving low dose TA regimen,~     assuming a power of 80% and a two-tailed value less than 0.05.~   ","","C0007202;C0008565;C2360800;C3163616;C0016006;C0543467;C0025663;C0032105;C0005767;C0005767;C0005767;C0005767;C0005767;C0005767;C0016006;C3889277;C0543467;C0746919;C0005767;C0332167;C0332167;C0151854",0,0

Gait disorders could be also partly related to noradrenergic system impairment,~     pharmacological modulation of both dopamine and noradrenaline pathways could potentially~     improve the symptomatology. The investigators have demonstrated using an open label study on~     17 advanced PD patients that chronic, high doses of methylphenidate (MPD) improved gait,~     freezing of gait, motor symptoms and attention in the absence of L-Dopa and increased the~     intensity of response of these symptoms to L-Dopa (Devos et al., 2007). The investigators~     aimed to confirm their results using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,~     parallel-group, multicentric trial. The investigators will assess the clinical value of~     chronic, high doses (1 mg/kg/day) of MPD vs placebo in 88 non demented PD patients suffering~     from severe gait disorders with freezing despite their use of optimal dopaminergic doses and~     eventually STN stimulation parameters. Efficacy will be assessed directly and on video in the~     absence of L-Dopa and again after acute administration of the drug, both before and after a~     3-month course of MPD, using Stand Walk Sit test (primary criteria), the Freezing Of Gait~     trajectory, RGSE scale, the UPDRS scores, the dyskinesia rating scale, Achiron scales and~     using auto-questionnaires of Giladi, ABC scale and PDQ 39.

Anti-VEGF~     agents the VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, and the small molecule VEGF receptor~     tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Angiogenic factors play a key role in the maintenance of lung~     integrity and normal endothelial function. Endothelial dysfunction has been implicated in~     hypertension, proteinuria and retinopathy. One of the major issues of anti-VEGF agents is its~     long-term toxicity especially taking into account the lack of adequate knowledge in this area~     and the possibility of prolonged periods of therapy in non-progressing patients. Hypertension~     and proteinuria are commonly seen in patients treated with anti-VEGF agents. In addition, the~     investigators have also observed in a relatively high frequency of pulmonary air-filled~     lesions in patients with malignancy in the lung treated with an anti-VEGF agent. Objectives~     of this exploratory study are to 1) determine the effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth~     factor (VEGF) on endothelial function 2) determine endothelial dysfunction as a marker of~     early response and as an indicator for the development of hypertension and proteinuria 3)~     characterize the effect of anti-VEGF therapy on the pulmonary function of patients with~     malignancy (primary or secondary) involving the lung in patients treated with anti-VEGF~     agents.

In asthma, the airways become inflamed and~     irritated which can cause coughing and make the airways tighten. This 'inflammation' is the~     root of the problem in asthma. Doctors have different ways to measure the inflammation in the~     airways. One way is to measure a gas called nitric oxide (NO) on the breath. This is made by~     the lungs when asthmatic inflammation is present. The investigators have been using NO as a~     test in research labs for many years, but there are still unanswered questions about how it~     changes between morning and night and how quickly medicines work on it. In most asthmatics,~     even small doses of inhaled steroids (preventers) can reduce the NO levels to normal, but in~     some people this does not seem to happen.

"NCT01058980","Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation_page_rank.csv","ADenosine Following Pulmonary Vein Isolation to Target Dormant Conduction Elimination: the ADVICE Trial","~     Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, impairs quality of life~     and increases stroke risk and mortality. Despite advances in medical treatment, AF remains~     uncontrolled in many patients. In many patients, AF is initiated by abnormal electrical~     impulses from the pulmonary veins. A catheter ablation procedure called pulmonary vein~     isolation (PVI) has therefore been developed, using heat to isolate the PV foci from the~     heart. PVI is very effective, but must be repeated in up to 50% of cases because the foci~     isolation is not permanent after initial PVI. The intravenous administration of a drug called~     adenosine during the PVI procedure can unmask residual conduction that would otherwise remain~     unnoticed, so-called dormant conduction. In our experience, additional ablation guided by~     adenosine reduces AF recurrence and the need for a repeat PVI procedure. However, the~     adenosine-guided approach has not yet been proven as standard therapy. The present study, to~     be conducted at 15 clinical centres in Canada, Europe and Australia is therefore intended to~     evaluate the efficacy of adenosine-guided ablation to prevent AF recurrence. Five hundred~     twenty-six patients will be included in the study, which should be completed within 2 years.~     In all patients, the presence of dormant conduction will be tested with adenosine during PVI.~     If dormant conduction is observed, additional ablation will be performed in half of these~     patients selected randomly. If there is no dormant conduction, randomly selected patients~     will be followed in a registry. If the adenosine-guided approach is demonstrated to improve~     the success rate of PVI procedures, it should become the standard approach for a permanent~     cure of AF, and therefore benefit patients by reducing arrhythmia recurrence,~     hospitalizations and the need for repeat interventions.~   ","C0221102;C0001443;C0150600;C0034090","C0004238;C0034090;C0596545;C0034897;C0034897;C0003811;C0001443;C0001443;C0001443;C0001443;C0001443;C0001443;C0205161;C0547070;C0547070;C0547070;C0547070;C0150312;C0871269;C0038454;C0018787;C0018787;C0019993;C0034090;C0034897;C3845829;C2947996;C0184511;C0376495",0,0

If the proposed objectives are fulfilled, this~          would contribute to an improvement in patients health in long term, along with an~          enormous saving in public health. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to propose~          new lines of intervention in overweight and obese adults that, until now, little have~          been investigated. This way, resistance training is proposed in combination with~          cardiovascular training and endocrinologic treatment.

The aim of this study is to~     evaluate the changes in platelet reactivity following CABG and to clarify a potentially~     beneficial effect of dual antiplatelet therapy in the group of patients with documented~     aspirin resistance following CABG. Platelet function will be assessed by multiple electrode~     aggregometry. Aortocoronary vein graft disease is comprised of three distinct but~     interrelated pathological processes: thrombosis, intimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis.~     Early vein thrombosis is a major cause of vein graft attrition during the first month after~     CABG.~      Bypass patency can be improved with antiplatelet therapy which is the mainstay of treatment~     for patients after CABG. A beneficial effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) on vein graft~     patency has been previously shown. Some patients experience thrombotic events despite~     continuous aspirin administration after CABG. The investigators hypothesized that low~     responsiveness to aspirin might be a precipitating factor for adverse thrombotic events~     following CABG.~      Low responsiveness to ASA, as assessed by platelet function tests, varies widely among~     patients. The etiology of postoperative platelet hyperactivity remains to be elucidated.~      In this study a new point-of-care assay named multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) using a~     device called Multiplate analyzer (Dynabyte, Munich, Germany) has been utilized. It allows~     for rapid and standardized assessment of platelet function parameters.~      This is a prospective randomized trial. The aim of the study is to document whether~     introduction of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with ASA resistance will lead to a~     lower incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at a six month follow up. The~     composite endpoint will include death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiac~     rehospitalization.

Although~     this hypothermia-induced platelet dysfunction seems to be reversible with warming, this is~     not always possible or desirable.~      Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a drug which has proven efficacy in improving platelet function in~     uraemic and cirrhosis patients, and in reducing blood loss in selected surgeries.

This standard of care is based partly on our inability to rapidly~     recognize and respond to AF recurrences which can often be brief and asymptomatic, but~     exposes the patient to the risk of anticoagulant-induced hemorrhage even during prolonged~     periods of sinus rhythm where the risk of stroke is presumably low.~      Recent advances in device technology and drug therapy, however, have the potential to change~     the way the investigators manage AF. The use of a small leadless subcutaneous implantable~     cardiac monitor with remote data transmission capabilities (Reveal XT, Medtronic Inc.)~     provides the ability to remotely and continuously evaluate a patient for AF recurrences, even~     episodes that are brief and asymptomatic. In addition, release of unique oral thrombin~     inhibitor approved for use in non-valvular AF(Dabigatran [Pradaxa], Rivaroxaban [Xarelto])~     allows for rapid onset anticoagulation within minutes to hours of a single oral dose.~     Together, these advances allow for continuous AF monitoring with targeted anticoagulation~     only around the time of an AF episode, thereby reducing the risk of drug-induced hemorrhage~     while still protecting against stroke.~      The aim of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of intermittent anticoagulation with~     a rapid-onset oral thrombin inhibitor guided by a continuous AF-sensing implantable cardiac~     monitor (Reveal XT) with remote data transmission capabilities.~   ","C0220825;C0871269","C0004238;C0035648;C0232201;C0013216;C1739768;C0019080;C0205161;C0087086;C0040018;C0871269;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0018787;C0018787;C2948600;C0179608;C0003280;C0034897;C0034897;C0019080;C0040018;C0723338;C2348066;C0588436;C2732140;C1330542",16,413

The survey will also aim to include up to~          100 neurologists from Germany of which approximately 50 will have prescribed Trobalt™.~      Patients eligible for the survey will be asked to take the survey online or via a telephone~     interview if the latter is preferred. Neurologists will be invited to take the survey online.~      The selected countries were the first five countries to launch Trobalt™ (Germany, Denmark,~     United Kingdom, Switzerland and Sweden) and an additional three countries with launch in~     2011, but with relatively high rates of uptake of Trobalt™ (Spain, Slovakia and Norway). The~     selection of countries includes Switzerland, which is not part of the European Union.~     However, the key messages regarding the risks with Trobalt™ are in alignment. The rationale~     for surveying the first five countries to launch is so that any issues identified from these~     countries regarding the effectiveness of the Physician's Guide and PIL in communicating the~     risks of Trobalt™ can be addressed as soon as possible, and the key messages can be revised~     in a timely manner. In addition, these countries are likely to provide the greatest number of~     neurologists with experience of prescribing Trobalt™, and their patients.~      The primary outcome of the survey is the proportion of patients/neurologists providing~     correct responses to a series of questions concerning the significant risks associated with~     Trobalt™.

Dual antiplatelet therapy of acetylsalicylic~     acid (ASA) with P2Y12 receptor antagonists such as clopidogrel is a cornerstone in the~     treatment of patients with advanced CAD. Due to delayed onset of action, intersubject~     variability or resistance to clopidogrel, different platelet aggregation inhibitors have been~     developed. Ticagrelor is a reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonist with superior efficacy~     compared to clopidogrel in the prevention of cardiovascular death in these patients.~      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is also associated with thromboembolic events and substantial~     mortality. Beside vitamin K antagonists (VKA, phenprocoumon) for stroke prevention in~     patients with AF, the direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban and the direct thrombin~     inhibitor dabigatran have recently received approval for prophylactic treatment of patients~     with non-valvular AF.~      However, there is a lack of efficacy or safety data for the combined impact of antithrombotic~     drugs in patients requiring arterial and venous thromboembolic prophylaxis due to their~     underlying co-morbidities.~      Study objectives: To evaluate the effect of ticagrelor + ASA in combination with dabigatran,~     rivaroxaban or phenprocoumon at steady state on markers of coagulation activation. The~     effects on coagulation activation will also be studied after a single dose of dabigatran,~     rivaroxaban or ticagrelor and at a therapeutic INR of phenprocoumon.~      Study design: A single-centre, prospective, randomized, controlled, analyst-blinded study in~     three parallel-groups. Subjects will receive ticagrelor + ASA in combination with dabigatran~     (treatment A), rivaroxaban (treatment B) or phenprocoumon (treatment C). All IMPs will be~     administered at doses indicated for stroke prevention in AF or ACS. Markers on thrombin~     generation and platelet activation will be studied in venous blood where coagulation is in~     resting state and in shed blood where the clotting system is activated in the~     microvasculature in vivo: prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), thrombin-anti-thrombin (TAT),~     β-thromboglobulin (β-TG), D-Dimer, thromboxane B2 (TxB2), CD40 ligand (CD40L), p-Selectin.~     Further, the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), inhibition of factor Xa activity, activated~     partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), Biophen® and Hemoclot® will be~     assessed in venous blood.~      Study population: A total of 60 healthy, non-smoking and drug-free male volunteers will be~     enrolled in this trial and randomized into one of three balanced groups (treatment A, B and~     C; n = 20 per group).~      Main outcome variables: β-TG, F1+2 and TAT in shed blood~      Additional outcome variables:~        -  D-Dimer, TxB2, CD40L and p-Selectin in shed blood~        -  β-TG, F1+2, TAT, D-Dimer, TxB2, CD40L, p-Selectin, ETP, aPTT, PT, inhibition of factor~          Xa, Biophen® and Hemoclot® in venous blood~      Risk/ benefit assessment:Total blood loss will be, dependent on treatment allocation, between~     330 ml and 510 ml throughout the entire study period of 4 - 5 weeks. This amount of venous~     blood is considered to be acceptable in this healthy population. Blood sampling procedures~     may cause mild and transient pain. A minor haematoma may occur at the site of needle~     insertions. Bleeding time incisions may leave small persistent scars. Administration of the~     study drugs, in particular as triple combination for 5 days, results in transient~     hypocoagulability and may cause overt or occult bleeding. The risk is considered low in the~     healthy subjects under study. Continuous monitoring of safety parameters (haemoglobin,~     haematocrit, platelet count, coagulation) and surveillance of the overall status will be~     performed during study participation. Subjects will be instructed to avoid vigorous physical~     exercise and handling of hazardous machinery during study participation.

Statistics show that~     approximately 91% of individuals with CVD have vascular dysfunction. Hypertension is a major~     modifiable risk factor for CVD and approximately 60% of adults in the US are pre-hypertensive~     and hypertensive. In addition, the prevalence of hypertension is associated with aging in~     both genders; however, the increase in blood pressure (BP) in women after menopause exceeds~     that of men.~      The development of effective and safe strategies to improve vascular function is of~     significance as it can have a great impact on quality of life, productivity and economic~     burden for the affected populations. One such alternative would be to introduce into the diet~     food sources that are rich in naturally occurring bioactive compounds. Thus, the long-term~     goal of the investigators is to provide feasible and effective dietary ways for~     postmenopausal women to improve their vascular function and quality of life.~      Strawberries are a rich source of bioactive compounds and its total antioxidant content ranks~     third among all fruits and vegetables. Hence, the purpose of this study is to bring forth~     evidence that incorporation of strawberries into the diet will reduce blood pressure and~     improve cardiovascular function in pre- and stage 1-hypertensive postmenopausal women.~      Sixty eligible postmenopausal women between the ages of 45 and 65 and a seated BP of ≥ 130/85~     mm Hg but ≤ 160/100 mmHg at the screening visit will be randomly assigned to one of three~     groups:~        1. 25 g freeze-dried strawberry powder;~        2. 50 g freeze-dried strawberry powder; or~        3. placebo powder.

Serum levels of markers of cardiovascular~          function as well as oxidative stress and inflammation will be measured.~      The investigators hypothesize that regular consumption of strawberry will improve~     cardiovascular function, decrease BP and blood markers of oxidative stress as well as~     inflammation.

The~     Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework suggests~     that for knowledge translation to be effective, there must be evidence of benefit, a context~     conducive to implementation, and facilitation to support uptake. We hypothesize that while~     the evidence and context components of this framework are satisfied, that uptake into~     practice has been insufficient because of a lack of facilitation. This protocol describes the~     rationale and methods of a feasibility study to test a facilitated pharmacy practice~     intervention based on the PARiHS framework, to assist community pharmacists in increasing the~     number of formal and documented medication management services completed for patients with~     diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.~      Methods: A cluster-randomized before-after design will compare ten pharmacies from within a~     single organization, with the unit of randomization being the pharmacy.

The~     Alberta Context Tool will be used to establish the context of practice in each pharmacy.~     Pharmacies randomized to the intervention will receive task-focused facilitation from an~     external facilitator, with the goal of developing alternative team processes to allow the~     greater provision of medication management services for patients with diabetes, hypertension,~     and dyslipidemia.

Epilepsy onset is most common in the~     first two years of life and is associated with poor prognosis for seizure control and~     neurodevelopmental outcome.~      The ketogenic diet (KD) is a medically supervised diet that is high in fat and restricted in~     carbohydrates and protein. KD therapy has shown to be an effective treatment for seizures in~     children with epilepsy older than two. Associated benefits include: a reduced requirement for~     routine and emergency antiepileptic drugs (AED) and fewer seizure related hospital~     admissions.

"NCT02272283","hypertension safe treatments_page_rank.csv","Optical Coherence Tomography Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Stent Implantation","~     Coronary artery disease is one of the most prevalent diseases in the western countries.~      A waxy substance called plaque can build up inside the coronary arteries. Over time, plaque~     can harden or rupture, and cause narrowing (stenosis) of the arteries and reduce the flow of~     oxygen-rich blood to the heart.~      The standard treatment of symptomatic coronary stenosis is percutaneous coronary intervention~     (PCI) with balloon dilation followed by stent implantation.~      A stent is a small metallic grid that stabilizes the coronary vessel wall after the balloon~     dilation.~      Currently, drug-eluting stents (DES) are the most widely used stent types. DESs consist of a~     metallic backbone and an antiprolifetive drug-coating bound by a polymer (glue). These~     devices have reduced the incidence of excessive formation of new tissue (in-stent restenosis)~     dramatically in comparison with previously used bare-metal stents.~      However, there are safety concerns with DES, since later thrombotic events have been~     reported.~      On one hand excessive tissue formation inside the stent can cause in-stent restenosis, and on~     the other hand insufficient coverage of the stent can cause persistently exposed metalllic~     material that can induce platelet aggregation and thrombus-formation.~      The etiology to stent thrombosis is multifactorial. Possible predisposing factors are, among~     others: 1) hypersensitivity towards the polymer-coating, which may induce delayed healing~     inside and around the stent, and 2) insufficient contact between the stent and the underlying~     coronary vessel wall (incomplete stent apposition), which may cause flow-disturbance and~     delayed healing.~      Delayed healing causes persistently exposed metallic material that can induce platelet~     aggregation and thrombus-formation.~      The Nobori stent is a new-generation DES, coated with a thin layer of drug and a~     bioabsorbable polymer. The drug is localized on the outer side of the stent, and decreases~     the release of drug to the blood circulation. The bioabsorbable polymer is degraded after 6-9~     months after implantation, and decreases the risk of hypersensitivity-reactions in the vessel~     wall.~      The improved pharmacokinetic profile of the stent is thought to improve the healing pattern.~      At routine coronary angiography, a small plastic tube is inserted in the femoral artery under~     local anesthesia. Thin, flexible catheters are then advanced through the artery system~     (femoral artery and aorta) to the coronary arteries. Contrast is injected in to the blood~     stream by the catheters, and the arteries are depicted by a special X-ray technique during~     dye-release. By angiography, the outer sides of the coronary arteries are visualized, and~     balloon dilations and stent implantations are guided by this standard technique.~      Newer studies have documented that stent placement and expansion is superiorly visualized if~     supplementary intravascular imaging is performed during stent implantation.~      Small imaging catheters are wired through the vessel after stent implantation, and film the~     stent retrogradely through the vessel.~      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) visualizes the complete vessel wall by use of sound waves,~     and stent expansion is evaluated in detail.~      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a newer light-based, high-resolution technology. The~     technique can depict every thread (strut) from the stent, enabling visualization of both~     contact between struts and underlying vessel wall immediately after the procedure, and strut~     coverage at follow-up.~      The purpose of this study is to determine whether OCT-guided PCI can improve healing and~     coverage of the stent in comparison with routine angiographic guidance alone in patients~     indicating PCI due to myocardial infarction.~      If OCT-guidance improves coverage of the stent, this might lower the later thrombotic risk.~      Patients hospitalized due to myocardial infarction are randomized either to OCT-guided or~     angio-guided stent implantation in the present study. In both groups the Nobori stent is~     implanted according to standard techniques. In the angio-guided group, implantations are~     guided by angiography alone. OCT- and IVUS analysis are performed after an angiographic~     optimal result for documentary reasons. The operator is blinded towards the image findings,~     and analysis is performed offline later.~      In the OCT-guided group, both OCT and IVUS analysis is interpreted immediately after the~     acquisition. If stent apposition and/or expansion is deemed suboptimal, additional balloon~     dilation and/or stenting is performed. In case of OCT-driven stent optimization, a~     documentary OCT and IVUS is performed to document the final result.~      Patients are readmitted 6 months later for a control angiogram inclusive OCT to assess stent~     coverage.~      Furthermore, patients are readmitted 12 months after the index procedure for a control~     angiogram including OCT and IVUS to assess dynamic vessel wall responses.~   ","C1532338;C0040395","C1456025;C1956346;C0027051;C0085532;C0002921;C0040053;C1301725;C0040395;C0002978;C0002978;C0003842;C1261287;C0003842;C1261287;C0087086;C0332149;C0087086;C0184511;C0003842;C0003842;C0003842;C1171285;C2348535;C3203359;C0150312;C0030054;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0005767;C0005767;C0003483;C1704922;C0918012;C0018563;C0018563;C1532338;C0027051;C0004704;C1301746;C0012634;C0184511;C0184511;C0004704;C0148346;C0577620;C0577620;C1522577;C1261287;C0005767;C1449882;C1449882;C2947996;C2947996;C2947996;C2947996;C2947996;C0184511;C1630418;C0376495;C0012725",0,0

These~     devices have reduced the incidence of excessive formation of new tissue (in-stent restenosis)~     dramatically in comparison with previously used bare-metal stents.~      However, there are safety concerns with DES, since later thrombotic events have been~     reported.~      On one hand excessive tissue formation inside the stent can cause in-stent restenosis, and on~     the other hand insufficient coverage of the stent can cause persistently exposed metalllic~     material that can induce platelet aggregation and thrombus-formation.~      The etiology to stent thrombosis is multifactorial. Possible predisposing factors are, among~     others: 1) hypersensitivity towards the polymer-coating, which may induce delayed healing~     inside and around the stent, and 2) insufficient contact between the stent and the underlying~     coronary vessel wall (incomplete stent apposition), which may cause flow-disturbance and~     delayed healing.~      Delayed healing causes persistently exposed metallic material that can induce platelet~     aggregation and thrombus-formation.~      The Nobori stent is a new-generation DES, coated with a thin layer of drug and a~     bioabsorbable polymer. The drug is localized on the outer side of the stent, and decreases~     the release of drug to the blood circulation. The bioabsorbable polymer is degraded after 6-9~     months after implantation, and decreases the risk of hypersensitivity-reactions in the vessel~     wall.~      The improved pharmacokinetic profile of the stent is thought to improve the healing pattern.~      At routine coronary angiography, a small plastic tube is inserted in the femoral artery under~     local anesthesia. Thin, flexible catheters are then advanced through the artery system~     (femoral artery and aorta) to the coronary arteries. Contrast is injected in to the blood~     stream by the catheters, and the arteries are depicted by a special X-ray technique during~     dye-release. By angiography, the outer sides of the coronary arteries are visualized, and~     balloon dilations and stent implantations are guided by this standard technique.~      Newer studies have documented that stent placement and expansion is superiorly visualized if~     supplementary intravascular imaging is performed during stent implantation.~      Small imaging catheters are wired through the vessel after stent implantation, and film the~     stent retrogradely through the vessel.~      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) visualizes the complete vessel wall by use of sound waves,~     and stent expansion is evaluated in detail.~      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a newer light-based, high-resolution technology. The~     technique can depict every thread (strut) from the stent, enabling visualization of both~     contact between struts and underlying vessel wall immediately after the procedure, and strut~     coverage at follow-up.~      The purpose of this study is to determine whether OCT-guided PCI can improve healing and~     coverage of the stent in comparison with routine angiographic guidance alone in patients~     indicating PCI due to myocardial infarction.~      If OCT-guidance improves coverage of the stent, this might lower the later thrombotic risk.~      Patients hospitalized due to myocardial infarction are randomized either to OCT-guided or~     angio-guided stent implantation in the present study. In both groups the Nobori stent is~     implanted according to standard techniques. In the angio-guided group, implantations are~     guided by angiography alone. OCT- and IVUS analysis are performed after an angiographic~     optimal result for documentary reasons. The operator is blinded towards the image findings,~     and analysis is performed offline later.~      In the OCT-guided group, both OCT and IVUS analysis is interpreted immediately after the~     acquisition. If stent apposition and/or expansion is deemed suboptimal, additional balloon~     dilation and/or stenting is performed. In case of OCT-driven stent optimization, a~     documentary OCT and IVUS is performed to document the final result.~      Patients are readmitted 6 months later for a control angiogram inclusive OCT to assess stent~     coverage.~      Furthermore, patients are readmitted 12 months after the index procedure for a control~     angiogram including OCT and IVUS to assess dynamic vessel wall responses.~   ","C1532338;C0040395","C1456025;C1956346;C0027051;C0085532;C0002921;C0040053;C1301725;C0040395;C0002978;C0002978;C0003842;C1261287;C0003842;C1261287;C0087086;C0332149;C0087086;C0184511;C0003842;C0003842;C0003842;C1171285;C2348535;C3203359;C0150312;C0030054;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0005767;C0005767;C0003483;C1704922;C0918012;C0018563;C0018563;C1532338;C0027051;C0004704;C1301746;C0012634;C0184511;C0184511;C0004704;C0148346;C0577620;C0577620;C1522577;C1261287;C0005767;C1449882;C1449882;C2947996;C2947996;C2947996;C2947996;C2947996;C0184511;C1630418;C0376495;C0012725",0,0

The most severe forms~     are caused by Plasmodium (P) falciparum and to a much lesser extent by P. vivax.~      Although the interest in research on malaria has increased during the last years, yet little~     research is conducted on the neglected malaria species P. ovale and P. malariae. P. ovale~     being first described in 1922, it still remains unclear whether it displays dormant~     pre-erythrocytic liver stages, so called hypnozoites, or not. Primaquine, the only marketed~     drug with liver stage activity at present, can cause severe hemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate~     dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient persons and methemoglobinemia. Because G6PD is widely spread~     in Central Africa, it is important to explore whether additional intake of liver-active~     medication is really needed and on this account further research to investigating new~     treatment options with liver stage activity should be conducted.~      While, due to widespread resistance, treatment recommendations for P. falciparum and mixed~     infections have switched from chloroquine to the safer applicable artemisinin-based~     combination therapies (ACTs), World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines still suggest~     chloroquine as first line treatment for P. malariae and P. ovale mono infections. Further~     studies assessing alternative treatment options are largely missing.~      Summing up the current situation for both topics shows the need for further research.~     Therefore this study aims to assess the evidence and characterize the frequency of relapses~     in P. ovale infections with respect to differences between its subspecies as well as the~     effectiveness of the ACT artemether-lumefantrine in P. malariae and P. ovale mono- and mixed~     infections.~   ","C0531104;C0024530;C0035020","C0025637;C0683525;C0683525;C0531104;C0237834;C0162791;C3714514;C0024530;C0024530;C0024530;C0150312;C0023884;C0023884;C0023884;C0023884;C0052430;C4284232;C3714514;C3714514;C3714514;C0024530;C0024530;C0024530;C0540173;C0035020;C3714514;C0376495;C0376495",0,0

The~     condition is defined by modified Wessel's criteria i.e. crying for more than 3 hours of the~     day, for more than 3 days of the week for at least 1 week.~      The description of infant colic hasalso been defined by Rome III diagnostic criteria~     andincludes infants from birth to 4 months of age,without failure to thrive, that are showing~     paroxysms of irritability, fussing or crying that starts and stops without obvious cause. The~     episodes last 3 or more hours/day and occur at least 3days/week for at least one week. The~     infant has no signs of central nervous system or intrinsic developmental difficulties, is~     normal on physical examination, and has normal growth patterns.~      Although infant colic is considered to be self limiting it is a distressing problem for~     families. It is in fact one of the most common reasons why parents seek the advice of a~     paediatrician or family practitioner during their child's first 3 months of life Up to 20% of~     infants under three months are affected by infant colic.~      Infant colic could have significant adverse effects on family quality of life and could even~     be a trigger for shaken baby syndrome. Parental perception associated with colicky complaints~     is therefor strongly recommended to be an outcome measure in trials of infantile colic.~      Measurement of parental/family quality of life and parental perception of colic severity with~     the help of a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in a Polish study showed that the use of a~     probiotic, Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938, could improve the perceived problems.~      The relationship between infant colic and gastroenterological, allergical and psychological~     disorders later in childhood was studied in a prospective study on 96 infants divided into~     two groups, colicky and non-colicky. The children diagnosed with infant colic, showed an~     increased susceptibility to recurrent abdominal pain, allergic and psychological disorders in~     childhood when they were 10 years old.~      The aetiology of infantile colic seems to be multifactorialbut is,despite many years of~     research, still unknown. The intestinal microbiota differs between infants with and without~     colic and has therefore been suggested to have a potential role. Other possible explanations~     are for example gut motility disturbances, low-grade mucosal inflammation and visceral~     hypersensitivity.~      Evidence suggests thatadministration of the probioticL. reuteri DSM 17938 might offer some~     benefit.L. reuteri DSM 17938 has been tested for its effect on crying in colicky infants and~     has been demonstrated to have a significantly favourable effect on crying time in fivetrials.~     One is a randomized trial that compared the probioticto Simethicone; three areplacebo~     controlled randomized double blind trials and yet another is a placebo controlled randomized,~     single blind, observational study. A fifth studydid not find any effect.~      Combining the results in a meta-analysis from three double blind, placebo controlled~     randomized trials (published at the time of the analysis, including the neutral one) found~     that, compared with placebo, L. reuteri administration reduced crying time at day 21 with~     about 40 min.~      Recently it has been documented in a clinical trial that prophylactic use of L. reuteriDSM~     17938during the first three months of lifereduced the onset offunctional gastrointestinal~     disorders, particularly functional constipation, regurgitation and infantile colic.~      In conclusion, the administration L. reuteri DSM 17938 may reduce the crying time in children~     with infantile colic, especially those fed predominantly or exclusively with breast milk.~     However, further randomized controlled studies, are required to be able develop~     recommendations in the management of infant colic.~      The present trial is undertaken to further document the effect of L. reuteri DSM 17938 on~     crying in colicky infants.~   ","C1135167;C0242296","C0031809;C0686721;C0015544;C0879626;C0266836;C0266836;C0012655;C0578019;C2004489;C0021368;C0009806;C0678257;C0037138;C1301725;C0332149;C1510470;C0033213;C0150312;C0150600;C0006141;C0005615;C0030193;C0699819;C0266836;C0266836;C1301746;C0184511;C0032042;C0032042;C0032042;C0723338;C0596601;C0222045;C1135167;C3845829;C3845829;C0042779;C0577620;C0180112;C0180112;C0180112",0,0

A catheter-based AF ablation technique that isolates pulmonary veins~     (PV) from the left atrium has been established to disrupt AF. Despite significant~     development, AF ablation with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is reported to have a success~     rate of 40-80% in various AF populations.~      Persistent AF appears to be more reliant upon fibroblast proliferation and myocyte-fibroblast~     coupling than paroxysmal AF with obvious implications on its management. Despite the~     knowledge that fibrotic substrate is responsible for the perpetuation of persistent AF,~     several ablation techniques targeting these extra-pulmonary veins sites have failed to prove~     an additional benefit to PVI alone. Nevertheless, two recently developed technologies, aimed~     at detecting AF substrate with high precision, seem to constitute a potential breakthrough in~     the management of persistent AF. On one hand, late gadolinium-enhanced MRI (LGE-MRI) is a~     well-established method to identify fibrosis in the myocardium. Recent reports from a single~     center have shown that MRI-based left atrial fibrosis detection is able to predict the~     outcome of the procedure. Hence, targeting lesions seen on LGE-MRI in the setting of~     persistent AF is an option yet to be explored and compared to the widely adopted, yet~     suboptimal, PVI. On another hand, a novel ablation method with promising results is focal~     impulse and rotor modulation (FIRM). Undergoing wide sampling of the atria with~     spatiotemporal and computational mapping while in AF has identified areas with stable~     organized rotational electrical activity (rotors). Several studies are under way to prove the~     reproducibility of rotor mapping, with more groups reporting improved rates of acute and~     long-term suppression of AF with ablation of FIRM-identified rotors.~      The SIMPle AF study will be a randomized clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that~     ablation tailored to the underlying substrate using either LGE-detected dense scar or rotor~     anchor sites predicted by computational modeling is superior to anatomic non-tailored PVI~     ablation in patients with persistent AF.

The standard treatment of sleep apnea is air pressure applied to the~     nose, so-called nasal CPAP, but it is not suitable for all patients. Another treatment is to~     use a dental appliance while asleep. In this treatment, an appliance covers the upper and~     lower teeth and acts to pull the jaw forward, which opens the throat passage. This allows the~     patient to breathe normally.~      Dental appliance treatment does not work effectively in all patients. In order to identify~     those in whom dental appliance therapy will be effective, the study sponsor has invented the~     remotely controlled mandibular positioner, MATRx. The MATRx is an FDA cleared motorized~     dental appliance which is used overnight in hospital sleep studies and works by pulling the~     jaw outward under the control of a technician.~      In order to eliminate the need for an overnight in hospital sleep study, the sponsor has~     invented a new device that allows for the identification of individuals who are suitable~     candidates for dental appliance therapy from the comfort of the home. Like with MATRx,~     participants will sleep with a motorized mandibular positioner in place. But, it is~     controlled by a computer, rather than a sleep technician, making it a computer controlled~     mandibular positioner (CCMP). The feasibility and predictive accuracy of multi night testing~     using the CCMP will be evaluated through participation in this study.~      The sponsor has carried out two previous research trials leading to the development of the~     CCMP. The first established the predictive accuracy of the remotely controlled mandibular~     positioner at identifying candidates suitable for oral appliance therapy and their effective~     therapeutic setting. The second established the accuracy of the algorithms used by the CCMP~     to similarly identify successful candidates in a clinical setting. No significant problems~     were identified in conjunction with our previous research protocol, and no significant risks~     were identified. This third protocol is to establish the feasibility and accuracy of the CCMP~     when used in the home setting.~      The trial will utilize data collected over a series of nights to formulate a prediction of~     therapeutic outcome with an oral appliance. The prediction will be tested by comparing the~     degree of airway obstruction without treatment (from data collected prior to the study) to~     the degree of airway obstruction with oral appliance therapy. A custom fit oral appliance~     will be provided to participants as part of the trial.~      The purpose of the study is to test the predictive accuracy of the CCMP in identifying~     favorable candidates for oral appliance therapy and in determining an efficacious protrusive~     position. Another purpose is to evaluate the convenience and possibility of carrying out a~     multi-night CCMP study in the home.~      There are no known risks or side effects to the CCMP studies, to the home studies, or to the~     oral appliance therapy. It is possible that participants will have some discomfort during the~     nights of the CCMP studies but this will be transient and not cause any long term damage.~     Participants may experience soreness of the teeth or jaw joint during adjustment of the oral~     appliance by the dentist. There is no risk of jaw dislocation or problems with the~     temporomandibular joint (TMJ).~      Participants will have the benefit of receiving a dental appliance for treating their sleep~     apnea at no charge. This will be supplied to participants by a dentist who is an expert in~     this field. Participation in the study will also allow the further development and ultimately~     commercialization of the CCMP device which may help individuals who have sleep apnea.~      Dental appliance therapy is just one of two therapies for sleep apnea. If participants choose~     not to have the dental appliance therapy, they may wish to try nasal continuous positive~     airway pressure.

"NCT03011762","Outcomes of cerebrovascular accident_page_rank.csv","Feasibility and Predictive Accuracy of an In-Home Computer Controlled Mandibular Positioner in Identifying Favorable Candidates for Oral Appliance Therapy","~     Sleep apnea is a condition in which the throat air passage closes during sleep and repeatedly~     interrupts breathing. The standard treatment of sleep apnea is air pressure applied to the~     nose, so-called nasal CPAP, but it is not suitable for all patients. Another treatment is to~     use a dental appliance while asleep. In this treatment, an appliance covers the upper and~     lower teeth and acts to pull the jaw forward, which opens the throat passage. This allows the~     patient to breathe normally.~      Dental appliance treatment does not work effectively in all patients. In order to identify~     those in whom dental appliance therapy will be effective, the study sponsor has invented the~     remotely controlled mandibular positioner, MATRx. The MATRx is an FDA cleared motorized~     dental appliance which is used overnight in hospital sleep studies and works by pulling the~     jaw outward under the control of a technician.~      In order to eliminate the need for an overnight in hospital sleep study, the sponsor has~     invented a new device that allows for the identification of individuals who are suitable~     candidates for dental appliance therapy from the comfort of the home. Like with MATRx,~     participants will sleep with a motorized mandibular positioner in place. But, it is~     controlled by a computer, rather than a sleep technician, making it a computer controlled~     mandibular positioner (CCMP). The feasibility and predictive accuracy of multi night testing~     using the CCMP will be evaluated through participation in this study.~      The sponsor has carried out two previous research trials leading to the development of the~     CCMP. The first established the predictive accuracy of the remotely controlled mandibular~     positioner at identifying candidates suitable for oral appliance therapy and their effective~     therapeutic setting. The second established the accuracy of the algorithms used by the CCMP~     to similarly identify successful candidates in a clinical setting. No significant problems~     were identified in conjunction with our previous research protocol, and no significant risks~     were identified. This third protocol is to establish the feasibility and accuracy of the CCMP~     when used in the home setting.~      The trial will utilize data collected over a series of nights to formulate a prediction of~     therapeutic outcome with an oral appliance. The prediction will be tested by comparing the~     degree of airway obstruction without treatment (from data collected prior to the study) to~     the degree of airway obstruction with oral appliance therapy. A custom fit oral appliance~     will be provided to participants as part of the trial.~      The purpose of the study is to test the predictive accuracy of the CCMP in identifying~     favorable candidates for oral appliance therapy and in determining an efficacious protrusive~     position. Another purpose is to evaluate the convenience and possibility of carrying out a~     multi-night CCMP study in the home.~      There are no known risks or side effects to the CCMP studies, to the home studies, or to the~     oral appliance therapy. It is possible that participants will have some discomfort during the~     nights of the CCMP studies but this will be transient and not cause any long term damage.~     Participants may experience soreness of the teeth or jaw joint during adjustment of the oral~     appliance by the dentist. There is no risk of jaw dislocation or problems with the~     temporomandibular joint (TMJ).~      Participants will have the benefit of receiving a dental appliance for treating their sleep~     apnea at no charge. This will be supplied to participants by a dentist who is an expert in~     this field. Participation in the study will also allow the further development and ultimately~     commercialization of the CCMP device which may help individuals who have sleep apnea.~      Dental appliance therapy is just one of two therapies for sleep apnea. If participants choose~     not to have the dental appliance therapy, they may wish to try nasal continuous positive~     airway pressure. Participants may withdraw at any time during the study without compromising~     their health care in any way. To withdraw, participants should simply notify one of the~     physicians or the research assistant.

"NCT03331822","Early Parkinson disease treatment_page_rank.csv","The Effects of Bright Light Exposure on ICU Nurses","~     In the majority of intensive care units, nurses work 12 hour shifts that consist of days and~     nights. Shift work outside of 6am-6pm has been reported to cause fatigue, induce sleep~     disorders, and cause metabolic disturbances. This shift to a nocturnal 'day' rather than~     diurnal, can result in reduced work performance, processing errors, accidents at work,~     absenteeism, and reduced quality of life. More chronically, those working at night have been~     shown to experience higher risks of heart disease, cancer and shorter median durations of~     life span. Much of this elevated risk is thought to be due to altered exposure to light, the~     dominant environmental cue regulating our circadian rhythms.~      As diurnal organisms much of our biology is regulated by the solar day. Acutely, bright light~     exposure (i.e., sun) regulates the phase of the biological clock principally through the~     suppression of melatonin, which biologically mediates increased alertness and in essence,~     'our daytime alertness'. During the night melatonin gradually increases and induces tiredness~     and ultimately sleep. This, in part, is biology behind the use of melatonin in those with~     sleep disturbances or to mitigate jet lag, with cross-continental or transoceanic flights.~      In this study, the investigators will randomize nurses in the hospital to receive either high~     intensity white light (3,000 lux) or standard ambient white fluorescent (~400 lx) light for~     10 hours during their night shift. This high illuminance light, rich in blue spectrum, is~     what diurnal creatures, like humans, are exposed to during the day. The lights may~     subsequently be equipped with blue filters (442 nm) to heighten the exposure to the rich blue~     spectrum light. Exposure will commence at the beginning of the night shift (~7pm) and~     continue for 10 hours. The rationale for terminating exposure prior to shift end is to foster~     an onset of sleep biology. At the end of each shift, the nurses will complete the Stanford~     Sleepiness Scale and the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). Saliva samples will be collected~     for melatonin level analysis and the nurses will complete sleep diaries at home.

This study will randomly assign participants to one of two groups,~     interventional or control. The interventional group will use the app with phone coaching and~     standard of care for weight loss. The control group will receive standard weight loss care~     without the app and phone coaching. Weight loss motivation to adopt life-style changes to~     maintain weight loss and quality of life between the two groups will be compared. The~     metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of disorders including high blood pressure,~     pre-diabetes, the tendency to carry body weight around the waist, and increased fat in the~     blood. When these problems happen together, there is an increased risk for heart attack,~     stroke, diabetes and certain cancers.~      Although the metabolic syndrome is a serious condition, it can be treated with diet, weight~     loss and increased activity. It can even be reversed using these lifestyle changes. Due to~     poor success with routine short-term weight loss treatment (group and one-on-one counseling),~     it is time to address the problem by a different method. Studies have shown feedback devices~     and weight loss apps have been successful in weight loss and weight maintenance. They are~     economical (many apps are free), and convenient to use, without attendance at group sessions.~     Since weight loss is the corner stone for improvement in the symptoms of the MetS, this study~     will offer a unique approach to support individuals who are committed to losing weight and~     adopting a healthier lifestyle.~      Numerous studies demonstrated that feedback via text messaging, and interaction through~     social networking support groups, in addition to iPhone apps, are all more effective in~     weight loss measures than group sessions at a hospital site.

The benefit of~     these various methods is that they appear to accelerate weight loss and prevent weight~     re-gain if employed long-term.

With the introduction of the 2017~     Guideline for High Blood Pressure in Adults from the American College of Cardiology and the~     American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines, the definition of~     hypertension became broader and as a result the prevalence is expected to further increase.~     On the other hand, it is estimated that around 10% of the world's population is affected by~     chronic kidney disease (CKD) with hypertension being both cause and complication of CKD.~      It is obvious that hypertension and CKD are interconnected and are both major risk factors~     for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertension results in increased CVD risk both directly,~     as an independent factor, and indirectly via its negative impact on renal function. In fact,~     the deterioration of the renal function is proportional to the degree of hypertension. On the~     other hand, the more advanced the CKD is, the more challenging the management of hypertension~     becomes, as patients with CKD present altered patterns of blood pressure (BP) during the day~     and, additionally, the prevalence of white coat and masked hypertension is significantly~     higher in this group of patients.~      To date, hypertensive patients are treated according to the BP recordings that are obtained~     in the office (OBP) during routine patient visits, which leads to inaccurate estimates of the~     true burden of hypertension and also affects the efficacy of the therapeutic intervention.

New term has been introduced -~     the post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI), characterised by: a change on the immunologic~     cells (neutrophilia, monocytosis, increased number of mesenchymal stromal cells, reduced~     expression of HLA-DR on monocytes, reduced function of natural killer (NK) cells, increased~     lymphocyte apoptosis, a shift in homoeostasis towards the Th2 phenotype facilitated by Treg~     lymphocytes - CD4+CD25+CD127-); a change in production levels of various cytokines~     (anti-inflammatory cytokines): IL-10, IL-4; anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokine: IL-6;~     pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, TNF-α, IFN-γ); the activation of the complement system (C5a~     and C3a via factor VII - tissue factor system, activated by cell damage).~      Post-traumatic immunosuppression can be made worse by transfusion, haemorrhage, stress,~     significant surgical operation and immunosuppressive drugs.~      The research has shown that Treg lymphocytes CD4+CD25+CD127- have an important role in~     controlling the acquired and innate immunity (comprising 6-8% of all CD4+ lymphocytes).~      Stopping haemorrhage prevents the occurrence of anaemia, as well as the need for transfusion~     of blood products, which lead to developing the post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI).~   ","C0003893;C0022742;C1527392","C4048329;C4048329;C4048329;C0016017;C0016017;C0016017;C0003893;C0003893;C0085702;C0015502;C0543467;C0150312;C3714660;C3714660;C1457868;C0005767;C0022742;C0022742;C0543467;C0543467;C0032788;C0035150;C4048329;C2946261;C3845829;C3845829;C1611174;C1611174;C1611174;C0019080;C0019080;C0019080;C0019080",0,0

Many~     adjustable and nonadjustable causes of obesity have been proposed, such as unbalanced eating~     habits, lack of physical activity, psychological factors, and genes. The practice guidelines~     recommended lifestyle modification interventions which include diet control combined with~     regular exercise as the core treatment for obesity, but the effects on different ethnic~     groups are not ideal. In order to provide more choices for future weight loss intervention,~     it would be important to find out more risk factors for obesity. Previous studies have shown~     that lower sympathetic activity assessed by heart rate variability was related to obesity;~     obese men have higher respiratory exchange rates which might indicate they are more likely to~     use carbohydrates as a source of energy, and therefore, fat cannot be effectively consumed~     and led to an accumulation in the body. Furthermore, previous studies showed that Asians are~     less satisfied with their body image than other races, and women are more dissatisfied than~     men. Poor body image will lead to a series of effects, such as changes in eating habits,~     hormonal changes, depression, etc., eventually forming a vicious circle of obesity. However,~     most aforementioned Asians in these studies are immigrants living in overseas areas such as~     the Americas, and cannot fully represent the ethnic groups in Asia.

AOT, well-grounded in neurophysiology, is an updated approach, based~     on mirror neuron system (MNS) used to rebuild motor function despite injuries by engaging the~     brain regions active during action execution in individuals with limited mobility. This~     project aims at identifying, for the first time in Italy, neurophysiological~     electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers able to predict rehabilitation outcomes and~     providing an innovative optimized AOT rehabilitation protocol for chronic Stroke outpatients.~     EEG will be recorded to identify the most effective stimuli, quantify changes/recovery,~     profile patients.~      Moreover, an innovative AOT home-based program will be implemented. The translational~     research results will ensure advances in the optimization and personalization of the~     rehabilitative process thus contributing to improve the quality of life of chronic stroke~     patients.~      Stroke is a leading cause of death and one of the greatest causes of long-term disability~     that interferes with a good quality of life. Nowadays the rehabilitation interventions are~     the major component of patient's care to achieve functional outcome. In the last few years,~     in order to improve Activity of Daily Living (ADL), new noninvasive strategies have emerged~     as rehabilitative treatments rather than traditional physical therapies. The Action~     Observation Treatment (AOT), supported by results collected through randomized controlled~     trials, is one of these. This new rehabilitation approach is based on the properties of the~     Mirror Neuron System (MNS; 11-13). The extensive research of the last 20 years on the human~     MNS (hMNS) showed its importance not only in action recognition but also in motor intentions~     and other social cognitive functions. Lastly, because recruited also in damage brain (18,19),~     the MNS is demonstrated to provide satisfactory rehabilitative outcomes. The AOT takes~     advantage of the opportunity to restore functions despite the patient's impairment and it~     seems to be a valid example of translational medicine from basic neuroscience to~     rehabilitation.

Nevertheless, equally impressive is the lack of clinically~     applicable therapeutic strategies that could mitigate these processes, thus providing~     significant cardioprotection. Despite the well-known fact that inflammation plays an~     important role in coronary artery disease development and progression, there have been few~     attempts to systematically examine the potential role of anti-inflammatory treatment in this~     setting, possibly because of a lack in anti-inflammatory agents without the adverse~     cardiovascular safety profile of corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.~     Colchicine is a substance with potent anti-inflammatory properties, having a unique mechanism~     of action, which allows for safe use in patients with cardiovascular disease.~      The purpose of the present clinical study is to test the hypothesis that a short course of~     treatment with colchicine could lead to reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in~     acute MI.~   ","C0027051","C0003209;C1956346;C0027051;C3887460;C3887460;C3887460;C0021368;C0022116;C0150312;C0332128;C3536840;C1522240;C1522240;C0012634;C0332149;C0376495;C1630418;C0376495",0,0
"NCT04246983","antiretroviral therapy first time_pageRank.csv","Point-of Care Ultrasound for Patients With HIV","~     Rationale: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is increasingly used by various specialists in~     the Netherlands, but its role in managing patients with HIV is unclear. In settings endemic~     for tuberculosis, Fast Assessment with Sonography for HIV/Tuberculosis (FASH) has proven its~     value to detect extrapulmonary tuberculosis in patients with HIV. However, there is no data~     to support POCUS for patients with HIV in resource affluent settings.~      Objective: The investigators aim to determine the feasibility and diagnostic value of POCUS~     in detecting opportunistic disease in HIV patients with advanced disease stages in the~     Netherlands.~      Study design: The investigators will perform a prospective observational pilot study.~      Study population: The investigators will include new adult patients with HIV presenting with~     a cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T-cell count below 350 cells/mm3, and all adult HIV~     patients requiring admission to hospital. Intervention (if applicable): The investigators~     will perform a focused ultrasound examination including FASH, and ultrasound of the lung,~     liver and kidneys. In case of positive findings additional examinations will be undertaken to~     determine the underlying pathology and/or treatment started as indicated. In case of negative~     findings, patients will be followed for 12 months to observe for (possibly missed)~     opportunistic infections.~      Main study parameters/endpoints: Our primary outcomes include acceptability of POCUS by~     patients, interobserver variation in interpretation of POCUS images, and number of diagnosed~     AIDS and non-AIDS related problems. Secondary outcomes include sensitivity and specificity,~     negative predictive value and positive predictive value of our POCUS protocol. In addition,~     incidence rates of opportunistic infections will be compared to a historical matched control~     group.~      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group~     relatedness: The ultrasound examination is painless and without risk to the participants. It~     will take approximately 30 minutes and will be combined with routine visits to the hospital.~     Benefits include potential earlier detection of opportunistic disease, while adverse effects~     may arise from false positive findings requiring further examinations which may cause stress~     or anxiety. The rate of false positive findings in POCUS has not been formally investigated,~     but appears low.
