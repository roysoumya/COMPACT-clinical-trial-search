NCT01738178,Caffeine as a Therapy for Parkinson's Disease,"Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder in which patients experience      progressive motor disability and many disabling non-motor symptoms. Recent studies have      consistently found that people who do not use caffeine are at higher risk of developing      Parkinson's disease. This suggests that caffeine may have potential as a treatment for PD.      In a pilot study of caffeine for daytime sleepiness in PD, there was evident benefit on the      motor manifestations of disease. There have been other lines of evidence that have suggested      caffeine could be useful in PD. This study is to evaluate the efficacy of caffeine 200 mg BID      vs matching placebo for motor and non-motor aspects of disease. This will be in three stages.      In the first six-month stage, medications will be held constant, to see whether caffeine does      have motor benefits. Then we will perform a four-year extension stage to define if the      effects of caffeine persist (or even magnify), and to see if caffeine helps reduce dose of      other PD meds and/or prevents their side effects. Finally, we will finish with a six-month      stage in which we will place all patients on caffeine - this will allow us to assess      caffeine's use in later disease, but more importantly, will assess whether early use of      caffeine produces long term changes beyond its immediate effects.",C0030567;C0006644;C0087111,C0524851;C0030567;C0030567;C0541854;C0877248;C0013227;C0237607;C0231170;C3242385;C0087111;C1697779;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0947630;C0012634;C0032042;C0012634;C0012634;C3245511;C4684637;C0947630;C0947630;C1561542;C1300072;C1300072;C1561542;C1300072;C1561543;C0042789;C0042789;C0426980;C0040399;C1518681;C1518681;C1525442;C3839460;C3843761;C1300072;C1328018;C1254223;C0220825;C0231617;C0722792;C0029166,0.0,0.0,0,6.0,6.0,0.024675720876689226,0.024373972503054942,0,1
NCT01993680,Orthostatic Dysregulation and Associated Gastrointestinal Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease -Treatment,"Disabling symptoms of blood pressure dysregulation, impaired swallowing and digestion are      common amongst Parkinson`s patients. So far the exact pathophysiology for this is not fully      understood. There are results from pathological analyses that the autonomic nervous system is      also affected by the accumulation of alpha-Synuclein and that this might even happen in very      early stages of the disease process (Qualman et al., 1984; Wakabayashi et al., 1989;      Wakabayashi et al., 1990; Bloch et al., 2006).      Blood pressure dysregulation is a common autonomic symptom in Parkinson`s patients and      treatment - currently most often achieved with Fludrocortisone - often leads to supine      hypertension (Plaschke et al., 1998; Braune et al., 1999; Magerkurth et al., 2005).      There are studies in patients with autonomic failure that indicate that Pyridostigmine      bromide might be an alternative treatment option without causing disabling supine      hypertension (Singer et al., 2003; Sandroni et al., 2005; Singer et al., 2006; Yamamoto et      al., 2006).      Delayed gastric emptying is also an autonomic symptom associated with Parkinson`s disease. By      the elevation of the cholinergic tone with Pyridostigmine bromide the investigators also      expect to alleviate symptoms of delayed gastric emptying and obstipation, possibly even      facilitating the uptake of dopaminergic medication through the gut (Sadjadpour, 1983;      Bharucha et al., 2008).      Therefore the investigators designed a monocentric randomized, controlled, double blind,      crossover phase II trial to show non-inferiority of the effect of pyridostigmine bromide vs.      fludrocortisone on symptoms of autonomic dysregulation in Parkinson`s disease.",C0030567;C2707256;C0277785;C0087111;C1317000,C0152020;C0152020;C0034262;C0392678;C0030567;C0030567;C0393911;C0683525;C0277785;C0016280;C0016280;C0005823;C0005823;C0034261;C0034261;C0020538;C0020538;C0221152;C0013227;C0012238;C0087111;C0439775;C0027769;C0012634;C1457887;C0947630;C1457887;C3245511;C3245511;C0243144;C1518681;C0439095;C0456909;C0699819;C1836729;C0242893;C1457887;C1457887;C1457887;C4055506;C0282151;C0162340;C2911690;C1300072;C1328018;C1328018;C0018792;C0450955;C0332149,0.0,0.0,1,1.0,1.0,0.01968600528043952,0.022534536699694817,0,1

NCT00914095,Study of Methylphenidate to Treat Gait Disorders And Attention Deficit In Parkinson's Disease (PARKGAIT-II),"~     Therapeutic management of gait disorders in very advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients~     can sometimes be disappointing, since dopaminergic drug treatments and subthalamic nucleus~     (STN) stimulation are more effective for limb-related Parkinsonian signs than for gait~     disorders. Gait disorders could be also partly related to noradrenergic system impairment,~     pharmacological modulation of both dopamine and noradrenaline pathways could potentially~     improve the symptomatology. The investigators have demonstrated using an open label study on~     17 advanced PD patients that chronic, high doses of methylphenidate (MPD) improved gait,~     freezing of gait, motor symptoms and attention in the absence of L-Dopa and increased the~     intensity of response of these symptoms to L-Dopa (Devos et al., 2007). The investigators~     aimed to confirm their results using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,~     parallel-group, multicentric trial. The investigators will assess the clinical value of~     chronic, high doses (1 mg/kg/day) of MPD vs placebo in 88 non demented PD patients suffering~     from severe gait disorders with freezing despite their use of optimal dopaminergic doses and~     eventually STN stimulation parameters. Efficacy will be assessed directly and on video in the~     absence of L-Dopa and again after acute administration of the drug, both before and after a~     3-month course of MPD, using Stand Walk Sit test (primary criteria), the Freezing Of Gait~     trajectory, RGSE scale, the UPDRS scores, the dyskinesia rating scale, Achiron scales and~     using auto-questionnaires of Giladi, ABC scale and PDQ 39.

Anesthesia in PD patients has been focused by several      studies for concerning the interactive reaction between anesthetics and anti-Parkinsonian      medication or Parkinsonian symptoms. However, our previous experience showed that the      patients undergoing pulse generator placement were more prone to be involved in delayed      emergence in the recovery room, which had been not reported yet. We speculated that PD      patients might be a special population with abnormal pharmacodynamic characters of      anesthetics, though no related evidence could be found to support this hypothesis. Therefore,      in this project we investigated whether remifentanl requirement to inhibit patients' response      to trachea intubation and skin insertion in PD patients undergoing DBS and pulse generator      placement was different from non-PD patients undergoing intracranial surgery for reasons      other than PD.",C0030567;C0246631;C4284141;C0087111;C0543467;C1550655,C0524851;C0242422;C0745377;C0030567;C0021932;C1140627;C1140627;C0002932;C0002932;C0002903;C0013227;C0237607;C0007952;C0441587;C0441587;C0441587;C0700287;C0205161;C1704632;C0947630;C4699618;C0222224;C2004454;C4284141;C0233492;C1546399;C0000828;C1555709;C0246631;C0701928,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.02099897535954672,0.01317837790153839,0,0
NCT03331822,The Effects of Bright Light Exposure on ICU Nurses,"~     In the majority of intensive care units, nurses work 12 hour shifts that consist of days and~     nights. Shift work outside of 6am-6pm has been reported to cause fatigue, induce sleep~     disorders, and cause metabolic disturbances. This shift to a nocturnal 'day' rather than~     diurnal, can result in reduced work performance, processing errors, accidents at work,~     absenteeism, and reduced quality of life. More chronically, those working at night have been~     shown to experience higher risks of heart disease, cancer and shorter median durations of~     life span. Much of this elevated risk is thought to be due to altered exposure to light, the~     dominant environmental cue regulating our circadian rhythms.~      As diurnal organisms much of our biology is regulated by the solar day. Acutely, bright light~     exposure (i.e., sun) regulates the phase of the biological clock principally through the~     suppression of melatonin, which biologically mediates increased alertness and in essence,~     'our daytime alertness'. During the night melatonin gradually increases and induces tiredness~     and ultimately sleep. This, in part, is biology behind the use of melatonin in those with~     sleep disturbances or to mitigate jet lag, with cross-continental or transoceanic flights.~      In this study, the investigators will randomize nurses in the hospital to receive either high~     intensity white light (3,000 lux) or standard ambient white fluorescent (~400 lx) light for~     10 hours during their night shift. This high illuminance light, rich in blue spectrum, is~     what diurnal creatures, like humans, are exposed to during the day. The lights may~     subsequently be equipped with blue filters (442 nm) to heighten the exposure to the rich blue~     spectrum light. Exposure will commence at the beginning of the night shift (~7pm) and~     continue for 10 hours. The rationale for terminating exposure prior to shift end is to foster~     an onset of sleep biology. At the end of each shift, the nurses will complete the Stanford~     Sleepiness Scale and the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). Saliva samples will be collected~     for melatonin level analysis and the nurses will complete sleep diaries at home. The~     investigators hypothesize that exposure to high intensity lighting during night shifts will~     reduce fatigue and enhance alertness and computational capacity that correlates with reduced~     melatonin.~   ",0,C0037317;C0085559;C0301625;C0596545;C0000924;C0025219;C0025219;C0025219;C0025219;C0015672;C0012634;C0015672;C0036087;C0018787;C0037313;C0037313;C2946261;C0037313;C0008810;C2926735;C0425104;C0025219;C0037313;C0222045,0.0,0.0,-1,1.0,1.0,0.002028397565922919,0.012690871205689595,0,0
NCT01092936,Italian Validation of the Revised MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale,~     The present study is part of an international program and deals with the translation and~     validation program for the Italian version of the MDS-UPDRS.~      The program will be articulated in three steps:~        -  Phase I: translation and back-translation of the MDS-UPDRS in Italian (completed)~        -  Phase II: Cognitive testing. This step is aimed at a preliminary testing of a subset of~          potentially culturally sensitive items in a limited set of PD patients (approximately~          10). Should this phase identify issues in the understanding and ease of use of some~          items a revised translation of some individual items might be envisaged.~        -  Phase III: large validation testing: this phase will involve 350 PD patients from 12-14~          Italian PD centres.~      The IRIS protocol deals with phase II and III of the program.~   ,C0012634;C0222045,C0150312;C2728259;C2728259;C0333052;C2728259;C0004600;C0022077;C2728259;C3834249,0.0,0.0,-1,0.0,0.0,0.014810150048885584,0.01265050499660888,0,0
NCT00724594,Safety of N-acetylcysteine in Maternal Chorioamnionitis (NAC in Chorio),~     The purpose of this trial was to find the best dose of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to decrease~     brain injury in babies exposed to intrauterine infection without causing significant side~     effects.~   ,C0008495;C0001047;C1858460,C0001047;C0694756;C3714514;C0006104,43.0,588.0,-1,25.0,12.5,0.007469137685476639,0.0061272501962770535,0,0
NCT03602014,Dose Response to the Norepinephrine Precursor Droxidopa in Hypotensive Individuals With Spinal Cord Injury,"~     The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of the drug Droxidopa (Northera) in~     increasing blood pressure in subject with hypotension, low blood pressure, which is~     classified as blood pressure less than 110/70 in males and 100/70 in females. The first aim~     is to determine the proportion of subject with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) who have a~     normotensive response to Droxidopa. The second is to determine the proportion of subject with~     SCI who express a hypertensive response to Droxidopa. A Normal blood pressure ranges from~     111-139 in males and 101-139 in females and a hypertensive blood pressure is anything higher~     than 140 in males and females.~      The study would take place in James J. Peters VA Medical Center (JJPVAMC) and The Icahn~     School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) in Manhattan, New York.~   ",C0028351;C0857353;C0037925;C0000378,C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0020649;C0037925;C0000378;C0000378;C0000378,0.0,0.0,-1,0.0,0.0,0.009501981798878343,0.006112690670605592,0,0
