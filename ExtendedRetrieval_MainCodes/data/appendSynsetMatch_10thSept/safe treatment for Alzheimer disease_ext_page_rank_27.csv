NCT03978338,A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Brain Polypeptide Solution in Mild Alzheimer's Disease,"~     In recent years, reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been found~     in dementia patients. BDNF reduces amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragments via the Trk~     signaling pathway, and the expression of transgenic BDNF in animal models of Alzheimer's~     Disease（AD）shows a protective effect on neurodegeneration. A lot of researches have proved~     that brain hydrolysate injection can improve the level of BDNF in the brain. And oral brain~     peptide dietary supplements, which is also derived from brain proteolytic products, may also~     adjust and improve neuron metabolism, promote the formation of synapses, induce the~     differentiation of neurons, and protect nerve cells from ischemia and neurotoxin damage,~     reduce the risk of loss of cognitive function in the aging process. However, there are still~     no studies on dietary supplements derived from brain protein hydrolysates in China.~     Therefore, the investigators designed a randomized controlled double-blind study program to~     preliminarily evaluate the efficacy, safety and possible mechanism of brain polypeptide~     solution in improving the cognition of mild alzheimer's disease patients.~      The research is a prospective, multicenter, cohort study. 200 patients with mild alzheimer's~     disease will be selected and randomly divided into experimental group and control group~     according to the numerical random table. The experimental group will take the brain~     polypeptide solution 60ml per day and the control group was treated with the same package of~     placebo 60ml per day. The treatment regimen remained unchanged during the observation period.~     During the study period, safety index including blood and urine routine, liver and kidney~     function, coagulation index and clinical effect index about neuropsychological scales will be~     recorded.~   ",C0002395;C0006104,C0002395;C3888347;C0025519;C0486805;C0009240;C0497327;C0022116;C0332149;C1522240;C2728259;C0012634;C0222045;C0006104;C0006104;C2946261;C0006104;C0006104;C0001811;C0006104;C0006104;C0918012;C0005767;C0042036;C0023884;C0918012;C0392335;C0184511;C0184511;C0032042;C0022646;C2946261;C3161035;C0006104;C0006104;C0242297;C0242297;C0033621;C0033621;C0180112;C0376495,0.0,0.0,-1,0.0,0.0,0.03534358914409203,0.040327608667193884,2,2

With recent advances in MR imaging, including optimized data acquisition and processing      techniques, tools that are especially well suited for tracking long-term pathological changes      as well as drug treatment effects have become available. In addition to structural imaging,      new acquisition and analysis techniques have been developed to determine integrity of      subcortical fiber tracts in vivo.      In the present project we propose to determine predictors of disease progression and      treatment response and investigate potential treatment effects on structural disease      progression, covering the continuum from axonal degeneration to cortical neuronal loss taking      advantage of recent advances in MRI acquisition and analysis techniques.",C0002395;C0016967;C0087111;C0939465;C1537007;C1305866,C0002395;C0242656;C0338656;C0011164;C0011164;C0011164;C0815275;C0815275;C0242656;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C1704632;C0079595;C0079595;C0150312;C0012634;C1185740;C0225326;C3245479;C0013227;C1578513;C1833299;C1518681;C1518681;C3839460;C2363670;C0308269;C0015733;C0001613;C4082977;C4082977,0.0,0.0,1,4.0,4.0,0.03332037537022359,0.030265555896512523,1,1

NCT03401619,Beijing Osteoporosis With Neurological Disorders in Epigenetic Changes Study,"~     Epigenetic modification refers to the change of heritable gene expression occurring in the~     case of unchanged DNA sequence, including DNA methylation, epigenetic modification, RNAS,~     chromatin modification, etc. The study found that osteoporosis (OSTEOPOROSIS,OP) with~     neurological disorders is very common, the risk of fracture of patients increased. It is~     considered that epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the occurrence and~     development of OP with neurological disorders. In particular, the role and molecular~     mechanism of epigenetic modification in OP with neurological disorders are not clear, and the~     results of clinical studies with different sample sizes are not consistent. (1) Two-way~     continuous queues,an ambispective cohort study， namely: forward-looking queue method~     (2017-2027) and Retrospective queue method (2007-2017) were used to understand the effect of~     epigenetic modification on bone mineral density, bone metabolic Biochemical Index, imaging~     index and fracture incidence of patients with neurological diseases in outpatients and wards,~     and to provide basis for further study. To observe the effects of epigenetic modification on~     cognitive function in two groups of patients (memory scale, life activity Energy meter (ADL)~     and cognitive scale (MMSE) and clinical physical examination and neuropsychological test,~     etc., Bone correlation detection (Lumbar and hip bone mineral density T-score, imaging index,~     bone Metabolic Biochemical Index and fracture incidence index) Influence. Multivariate~     stepwise regression analysis was performed to eliminate confounding factors, such as age,~     body mass index (BMI), related risk factors, and internal diseases. The patient's previous~     information is also analyzed; (2) To find meaningful epigenetic modification from clinical~     data, the molecular mechanism was studied in depth, and the imaging indexes (X-ray, CT, MRI)~     and Bone marker Index (serum osteocalcin (OC), total I-type procollagen peptide (TP1NP) were~     found in the study. Type I collagen hydroxy-terminated peptide beta degradation product~     (Β-CTX)). The relationship between the reaction epigenetic modification and cognitive~     function index, image and bone markers and the mechanism model were further established.~   ",C0029456,C0031809;C1305855;C3840684;C3840684;C3840684;C0029456;C0029456;C3840684;C3840684;C3840684;C0035648;C3840684;C3840684;C0373691;C0684321;C1511790;C0016658;C0016658;C0030786;C0016658;C0600653;C0025260;C0918012;C0918012;C1874451;C0918012;C0918012;C0918012;C0229671;C0918012;C1704922;C3161035;C0392335;C0012634;C0012634;C0025663;C0177804;C0222045;C0222045;C2947996,0.0,0.0,-1,0.0,0.0,0.03703703703703688,0.013734372052575616,0,0
