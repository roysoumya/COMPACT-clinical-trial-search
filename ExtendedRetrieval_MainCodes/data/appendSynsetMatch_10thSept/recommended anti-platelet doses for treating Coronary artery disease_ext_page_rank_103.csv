NCT02287909,Switching From Ticagrelor to Clopidogrel in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease,"The recommended antiplatelet treatment regimen for patients affected by acute coronary      syndromes (ACS) and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) consists in the      combination of aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. More potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitors,      such as ticagrelor, have been developed which are associated with less response variability      than clopidogrel and better clinical outcomes. Ticagrelor use has increased significantly      because of its more expanded Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications compared with      prasugrel. However, despite the evidence for sustained efficacy and safety, many physicians      limit treatment duration with ticagrelor to the early phases following an ACS mostly due to      cost issues and concerns about increased bleeding. Therefore, it is very common in clinical      practice to switch patients while on maintenance dosing (MD) with ticagrelor to treatment      with clopidogrel. However, the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of switching from ticagrelor to      clopidogrel remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of this investigation is to evaluate the PD      effects of switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel.",C1956346;C0070166;C1999375;C1550655;C0231530,C1533734;C1552578;C0184661;C0070166;C0070166;C0070166;C0070166;C1999375;C1999375;C1999375;C1999375;C1999375;C1999375;C0087111;C0039082;C1620287;C0087111;C0087111;C0018787;C0018787;C1704632;C0019080;C0237607;C0040808;C0004057;C1556133;C3245511;C0013227;C3539181;C1518681;C1518681;C2363670;C0231530;C0231530;C0700651;C0700651;C0332534;C3272565;C3272565;C0220825;C0332535;C0069695;C0151576;C0151576,0.0,0.0,1,3.0,3.0,0.00974734798430251,0.008635761334363666,0,5
NCT01957540,Differential Effect of Ticagrelor Versus Prasugrel Maintenance Dose on Endothelial Function of Peripheral Vessels in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease,"Ticagrelor administration, whose molecule resembles to adenosine, led to reduction in overall      mortality and thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) events when directly compared to clopidogrel in      the PLATO trial, implicating possible pleiotropic actions for the drug. It has been shown      that ticagrelor increases adenosine concentration, by interfering with its red blood cells'      uptake and by inducing the release of ATP which is then converted to adenosine. Recent      studies in healthy volunteers and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have shown that      ticagrelor increases the coronary blood flow in response to intravenous adenosine      administration. Ticagrelor administration, in comparison with other P2Y12 inhibitors, may      influence the endothelial function, as assessed by the Peripheral Arterial Tonometry method      (EndoPAT 2000 system (Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel), which is a method for evaluating      endothelial dysfunction and has been found to positively correlate with flow mediated      dilatation (FMD).      This is prospective, randomized study with a crossover design, which will be conducted in      patients with CAD under prasugrel maintenance dose (MD) 10mg once a day for at least a      3-month period. At Day 0 (day of randomization) eligible patients will be assigned to either:        -  Ticagrelor 90mg twice a day for the next 15 days or        -  Prasugrel 10mg once a day for the next 15 days At Day 0 (before treatment onset)patients           wiil be subjected to a baseline peripheral arterial tonometry measurement. Measurement           will be repeated at Day 15 and then treatment crossover will be performed for the next           15 days (without an intervening washout period). At Day 30 patients will be subjected           again to peripheral arterial tonometry assessment. Peripheral blood sample will be taken           from the patients in Day 0 for genotyping control.",C1956346;C1999375;C1620287;C1705273;C0005847;C1550655,C0010054;C0856169;C1277078;C1533734;C3887460;C1533734;C1533734;C0086045;C0178913;C0070166;C1999375;C1999375;C1999375;C0232338;C1999375;C1322279;C1999375;C0031809;C0001443;C4551656;C0001443;C0001443;C0001443;C0040420;C1620287;C1620287;C0087111;C0040420;C0087111;C0040420;C0332149;C0018787;C1704632;C0031843;C0003842;C1552601;C0680255;C0947630;C0199168;C0243144;C0025663;C0025663;C0025344;C0025344;C0043566;C0947630;C0013227;C0175306;C1561538;C1561538;C1561538;C1561538;C0489868;C0489868;C3843236;C1285573;C0202165;C1446409;C3842675;C0018792;C0127400;C0728774;C0040597,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.009874093161789905,0.011021780342034243,2,3

NCT02226510,MetfoRmin and Its Effects on Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in Normotensive Patients With Coronary Artery Disease,"Thickening of the heart muscle (left ventricle) known medically as Left Ventricular      Hypertrophy (LVH) is very common in patients with heart disease. This increases risk of      cerebrovascular/cardiovascular event.      LVH is asymptomatic and managed by the use of medication to control blood pressure, however      LVH may be seen in normotensive patients where factors such as obesity and insulin resistance      are present.      Insulin resistance is a condition where although the body produces insulin it is unable to      utilize it effectively. Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes, can reduce insulin      resistance and cause weight loss, it may therefore improve LVH. This study will investigate      the ability of metformin to reduce LVH in patients with heart disease, this may be a novel      way forward in the risk reduction of cerebrovascular/cardiovascular events. Participants will      be identified throughout NHS Tayside, those eligible will be randomly allocated to either      metformin or a dummy medication (placebo) and will receive one year of treatment. At the      beginning of the study, the thickness of the heart muscle will be measured by ultrasound scan      and cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI). We will also perform non-invasive tests to      measure blood vessel function. These tests will be repeated after one year. At the end of the      study, we will investigate the difference between placebo treatment and metformin treatment.

NCT01954303,HsTnT in Stable Coronary Artery Disease,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality      worldwide. Life threatening manifestations such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and      sudden cardiac death are the most important causes of death in many countries. Cardiac      troponin is a biomarker with a high specificity for cardiac necrosis and is recommended for      diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction by the Universal definition of myocardial      infarction. Since a new generation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays has become      commercially available a few years ago, myocardial infarction can be detected earlier and      even small AMIs, that were classified as unstable angina pectoris (UAP) with the less      sensitive assays, are detectable now. On the other side, more patients with acute or chronic      myocardial damage not due to AMI are identified now. Thereby, the reason for elevated      troponin levels should be sought actively, because high troponin levels were associated with      adverse outcome - independent of the underlying pathomechanism. The reasons for troponin      elevations in patients with stable CAD are not clear yet. Associations with extensive      atherosclerosis, carotid lesions and complex coronary plaques in coronary CT scans were      reported. Therefore, patients with elevated troponin levels represent a risk population and      might profit from intensified secondary prevention. In this context, ticagrelor might be part      of a prevention strategy as currently tested in the PEGASUS trial.      We plan to conduct a single-centre pilot study in a cohort with clinically stable patients of      our outpatient clinic, because data regarding prevalence, causes and prognosis of elevated      troponin values in unselected cohorts is sparse. Therefore, all patients (n=910) that      presented to our outpatient clinic 12 months after introduction of the high-sensitivity      troponin T assay (june 2009) and were free of complaints or presented with UAP are being      enrolled. All patients are characterized by demographic, laboratory and clinical      characteristics (including medication) and all available imaging data (exercise-ecg,      echocardiography, stress-echocardiography, computed tomography, cardiac MRI and coronary      angiography) in order to compare baseline characteristics of troponin positive and troponin      negative patients.

L-carnitine (LC) and coenzyme      Q10 is recognized as lipid soluble antioxidants. The purposes of this study are going to      investigate the relation of LC and coenzyme Q10 with the markers of lipid peroxidation,      antioxidant enzymes activities, and the inflammatory markers in coronary artery disease (CAD)      patients. The study is designed as a three-year study. The first year is an observation      study. We will recruit CAD patients who are identified by cardiac catheterization as having      at least 50% stenosis of one major coronary artery, and age-gender matched healthy subjects.      The concentrations of LC, coenzyme Q10, lipid peroxidation markers (TBARS and ox-LDL),      antioxidant enzymes activities (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and      superoxide dismutase), and inflammatory markers are going to analysis. The second year is a      single-blind, single dose intervention study. CAD subjects are recruit form the first year      and randomly assigned to placebo, coenzyme Q10-150 (150 mg/d), coenzyme Q10-300 (300 mg/d),      LC-1000 (1000 mg/d) or LC-2000 (2000 mg/d) groups. Intervention is going to administration      for three months. Fasting blood will be obtained in each month and determine the      concentration of LC, coenzyme Q10, lipid peroxidation markers, antioxidant enzymes      activities, and inflammatory markers after intervention. The third year is a single-blind,      multiple doses intervention study. We are going to measure the CAD subjects from the second      year intervention study. After three months washout period, the subjects are assigned to      placebo, coenzyme Q10-150 plus LC-1000, coenzyme Q10-150 plus LC-2000, coenzyme Q10-300 plus      LC-1000, and coenzyme Q10-300 plus LC-2000 groups. Intervention is going to administration      for three months. Fasting blood will be obtained in each month and determine the      concentration of LC, coenzyme Q10, lipid peroxidation markers, antioxidant enzymes      activities, and inflammatory markers after intervention.

NCT00981383,Treating Depression in Coronary Artery Disease With Omega-3 Fatty Acids,"Depressive disorders are common in patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), occurring in      up to 47% of patients. Left untreated, these symptoms not only have a strong negative impact      on quality-of-life, but also increase risk of future cardiac events and death. Unfortunately,      about 64% of CAD patients do not respond to current antidepressant treatments.      Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are two omega-3 (ω-3) fatty acids      found in fatty fish that are important for brain function. Recent evidence showed that      depressed CAD patients have lower levels of EPA and DHA than non-depressed CAD patients. This      information, taken together with the known roles of ω-3 fatty acids in brain function,      suggests that deficiencies may contribute to depression. However, it is unknown if increasing      consumption of ω-3 fatty acids would alleviate depression and improve quality of life. While      intake of adequate levels of ω-3 fatty acids is difficult to obtain through diet,      concentrated supplements containing EPA and DHA that are safe, readily available, and      inexpensive are now obtainable in Canada. CAROTID (CAD Randomized Omega-3 Trial In      Depression) will randomize patients with CAD, with and without depressive symptoms, after 6      months of cardiac rehabilitation and usual care to receive either ω-3 fatty acid supplements      or placebo daily during their final 6 months of cardiac rehabilitation. The investigators      hypothesize that CAD patients randomized to receive ω-3 fatty acid supplements will show      greater improvement in depressive symptoms and quality-of-life over time. The investigators      will also evaluate possible improvements in other important determinants of quality of life:      memory and other cognitive abilities.",C1956346;C0015689;C0011570,C1956346;C0700431;C0700431;C0000545;C0012968;C0086132;C0086132;C0518214;C0015689;C0015689;C0518214;C0015689;C0518214;C0518214;C0741923;C0003289;C0087111;C0011570;C0011570;C0011570;C0012634;C0332155;C0344315;C0344315;C0332218;C0205160;C0031843;C0031843;C0332149;C0015689;C1556133;C0741968;C0015689;C0032042;C3245511;C0025260;C0011065;C0006104;C0006104;C0015689;C0015689;C1457887;C0184511;C0392334;C3242430;C1947907;C3844714;C3897779;C4084912;C4084912;C1561542;C1561542;C1880310;C4697803;C0221106;C0220825;C1947943;C1947943;C1947943;C0162538,0.0,0.0,0,3.0,1.5,0.009493468621317684,0.006379350275133689,3,1

NCT00705965,Effects of a Psychotherapy Intervention in Depressed Patients With Coronary Artery Disease,"In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), depressive symptoms are frequent and highly      relevant for quality of life, health behaviour, health care costs, and prognosis. The aim of      the current study is to evaluate the effects of a psychotherapy intervention on symptoms of      depression in patients with CAD. Therefore, depressed patients diagnosed with CAD will be      randomised into a controlled intervention trial, comparing a stepwise psychotherapy      intervention with usual cardiological care. The manualized psychotherapy intervention starts      with three individual sessions offered on a weekly basis. Afterwards, symptoms of depression      will be re-evaluated and, in case of persisting symptoms, patients receive an additional 25      sessions of psychodynamic group psychotherapy over a total period of one year. The      psychodynamic approach was chosen in order to specifically take into account personality      traits such as negative affectivity and social inhibition, the components of the Type D      personality, which may explain why recent cognitive behavioural psychotherapy (CBT) trials      produced only small effects in depressed CAD patients. The investigators expect that the      intervention will reduce depressive symptoms as well as the prevalence of depressive      disorders. It will also improve both behaviourally and physiologically mediated      cardiovascular risk indicators, promote better quality of life, and reduce healthcare costs.      Subgroup analyses will be performed in order to identify gender-specific treatment effects,      effects on immunological stress reactivity, and genetic predictors of treatment success.",C1956346;C0033968;C0184661;C0344315;C1550655,C0010054;C0086132;C0086132;C0033971;C0086132;C0518214;C0035648;C0518214;C3887460;C0033968;C0033968;C0033968;C0871174;C0871174;C0033968;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0086388;C0003944;C0003944;C0011570;C0021467;C0086388;C0033325;C0344315;C0011900;C0344315;C0012634;C0087111;C0087111;C0205160;C1552740;C0025344;C0038435;C0947630;C1561543;C1552651;C0677505;C1457887;C1457887;C0184511;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C2911690;C0220825;C0233697;C0233697;C3858576;C1552850;C0018792;C1522411;C1522411;C0220825;C0127400;C0009244,0.0,0.0,0,19.0,3.1666666666666696,0.009370589301869372,0.011001863936276732,0,0

NCT00810992,Traditional Tibetan Medicine for Patients With Coronary Artery Disease,"Coronary artery disease has a high death toll in the Western world. Changes in lifestyle,      particularly in nutrition and physical activity may significantly reduce a severe coronary      atherosclerosis within one year without the use of medication. Several dietary studies have      shown that not only the progress of coronary artery disease can be slowed down, but it may      also increase significantly the survival of these patients.      Up until now there is little known about therapeutic effects by complementary medicine. In      particular, Traditional Tibetan medicine dietary programs have shown in few case reports that      weight could be reduced in patients with obesity.

NCT01316159,Prediction of Progression of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Using Vascular Profiling of Shear Stress and Wall Morphology,"Although atherosclerosis is a systemic disease, its manifestations are focal and eccentric,      and each coronary obstruction progresses, regresses, or remains quiescent in an independent      manner. The focal and independent nature of atherosclerosis cannot be due solely to the      presence of systemic risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, cigarette      smoking, and hypertension. Local factors that create a unique local environment are a major      determinant of the behavior of atherosclerosis in a susceptible individual.      The vascular endothelium is in a unique and pivotal position to respond to the extremely      dynamic forces acting on the vessel wall due to the complex 3-D geometry of the artery.      Mechanical forces in general, and fluid shear stress (endothelial shear stress [ESS]) in      particular, elicit a large number of humoral, metabolic and structural responses in      endothelial cells.      Regions of disturbed flow, with low and oscillatory ESS (< 1.0 Pa), are intensely      pro-atherogenic, pro-inflammatory, and pro-thrombotic, and correlate well with the      localization of atherosclerotic lesions. These sites demonstrate intense accumulation of      lipids, inflammatory cells, and matrix degrading enzymes which promote the formation of      high-risk thin-cap fibroatheroma.      In contrast, physiologic laminar flow (1.0-2.5 Pa) is generally vasoprotective. However, as      the obstruction progresses and further limits blood flow through a narrowed lumen, flow      velocity and ESS may increase excessively (> 2.5 Pa) at the neck, and decrease abnormally at      the outlet, increasing the likelihood of platelet activation and thrombus formation.      Identification of an early atherosclerotic plaque likely to progress and acquire      characteristics leading to likelihood of rupture and, consequently, to precipitate an acute      coronary event or rapid luminal obstruction, would permit more definitive pharmacologic or      perhaps mechanical intervention prior to the occurrence of a cardiac event. The potential      clinical value of identifying and ""eradicating"" plaques destined to become vulnerable before      they actually become vulnerable is enormous.      The purpose of the PREDICTION Trial is to identify high-risk coronary lesions at an early      time point in their evolution, to follow the natural history of these lesions over a 6-10      month period, and to confirm that these high-risk lesions are likely to rupture and cause an      acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or develop rapid progression of a flow-limiting obstruction.      The hypothesis is that local segments in the coronary arteries with low ESS and excessive      expansive remodeling will be the sites where atherosclerotic plaque develops, progresses, and      becomes high-risk, leading to a new cardiac event. This study is being conducted in Japan as      patients are clinically evaluated with followup coronary angiography and IVUS in a routine      manner at 6-10 months following their initial percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for an      ACS.      This is a natural history and a clinical outcomes study in patients who initially present      with an ACS. The natural history portion of the study is designed to describe the temporal      progression of atherosclerosis in segments of coronary arteries with low ESS and expansive      remodeling using intracoronary vascular profiling techniques utilizing intravascular      ultrasound (IVUS) and coronary angiography. The clinical outcomes portion of the study is      designed to evaluate the efficacy of coronary vascular profiling to predict segments of      coronary arteries that will become areas of rapid plaque growth or rupture leading to      recurrent major clinical coronary events.      Five hundred (500) patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI for a culprit lesion      are to be enrolled in the study to undergo coronary vascular profiling at the time of the      index catheterization procedure. Up to 374 consecutive patients with at least one low ESS      subsegment are to have follow-up coronary angiography and IVUS at 6-10 months to allow for at      least 300 patients with analyzable intracoronary vascular profiling data for assessment of      lesion natural history. All patients are to have a one-year clinical follow-up to assess for      new cardiac events, followed by two additional years of extended clinical followup.",C1956346;C0242656;C0038435;C0700329;C0005847,C0007430;C0948089;C0948089;C2936350;C2936350;C0085532;C0085532;C0085532;C0011849;C0205042;C0205042;C0205042;C0442893;C0004153;C0004153;C0004153;C0004153;C0020473;C0020792;C0741923;C0741923;C0741923;C0035648;C0020538;C0184661;C0184661;C0028778;C1290940;C1290940;C0028778;C0028778;C0242656;C0028778;C0242656;C0232338;C0041618;C0031809;C0018787;C0392148;C0005847;C0087086;C0018787;C0018787;C0018787;C0005847;C0018787;C0005847;C0018787;C4684790;C0018787;C0005847;C0005847;C0221198;C3203359;C0699493;C0221198;C0262512;C0221198;C0750484;C0221198;C3203359;C0262512;C0150312;C0262512;C3203359;C0262512;C0005847;C0003842;C0038435;C0038435;C0523744;C0332148;C0025344;C0332148;C0011389;C0018270;C0221198;C0221198;C0175735;C0175735;C1561542;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0918012;C0027530;C3245479;C1561543;C1550472;C1550472;C1578513;C1550472;C1550472;C1578513;C3849973;C3849973;C2948499;C1704632;C0677505;C0442797;C0935456;C3245488;C0564182;C4055506;C4693090;C2827758;C1882443;C0920995;C0011389;C1561528;C1561528;C0442743;C0022396;C0205161;C4085555;C2707259;C0220825;C0231519;C0449900;C3858576;C1561542;C1561542;C4331837;C1254223;C0221106;C0018563;C3272565;C1522577;C3272565;C3272565;C0220825;C3272565;C3272565;C3272565;C1522577;C0939261;C2363670;C0029166;C0031843,0.0,0.0,0,62.0,31.0,0.007874971030010428,0.010251584746578838,0,0

NCT01383304,Aspirin Response in High Risk Patients With Coronary Artery Disease,"Previous studies indicate that patients with cardiovascular disease have a variable response      to aspirin. Despite treatment with aspirin a large number of patients suffer a myocardial      infarction. This has given rise to the phenomenon ""aspirin low-responsiveness"". Laboratory      aspirin low-responsiveness can be defined as the failure of aspirin to inhibit platelet      production of thromboxane A2 or inhibit thromboxane-dependent platelet aggregation. Whether a      low platelet response to aspirin results in an increased risk of future thrombotic events is      of great clinical significance, but is still unknown.

NCT00627172,"Combined Use of Coronary MDCTA, Coronary Doppler Ultrasonography and PET Perfusion in Diagnosing Coronary Artery Disease","Multislice CT angiography is a novel but already established and widely used in diagnosing      coronary artery disease (CAD). It is very reliable in ruling out hemodynamically significant      narrowings in coronary arteries (Negative predictive value). However, it may overestimate the      severity of the stenoses in up to 30% of the coronary artery lesions (positive predictive      value 70%). However, when coupled with a functional or flow-sensitive diagnostic test, such      as PET perfusion or coronary doppler ultrasonography, one can assume that even the PPV may be      as high as 95 %. Despite this assumption, there`s no scientific evidence to support use of      such hybrid multi-modality tests at present.

NCT00641758,Pycnogenol and Endothelial Function in Coronary Artery Disease,"Pycnogenol® is a proprietary bark extract of the French maritime pine tree (Pinus pinaster      ssp. atlantica). Pycnogenol® has prevented pathologic symptoms such as chronic inflammation      and increased platelet aggregation, a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The      endothelium is increasingly recognized not only a target (with vascular remodelling occurring      in response to an injury and resulting in atherosclerosis), but also a mediator in the      pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Indeed, endothelial cells play an important regulatory role      in the cardiovascular system by the expression of numerous molecules and release of mediators      such as nitric oxide (NO), superoxide and endothelin-1 (ET-1).
