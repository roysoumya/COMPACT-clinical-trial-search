NCT00119054,Effectiveness of Home-Based Health Messaging for Patients With Hypertension and Diabetes,"Patients treated at Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers are older and have multiple chronic      conditions. Two of the most common conditions in the VA population are hypertension (HTN) and      Type 2 diabetes (DM). Unfortunately, DM and HTN have few perceptible symptoms on a daily      basis that motivate patients to comply with treatment recommendations and lifestyle changes.      Thus, serious complications and long-term adverse outcomes are common in both of these      conditions.      Home telehealth is a general term used to describe the delivery of health care services to      the patient's home using audio, video, or other telecommunications technologies. Although      home telehealth offers a number of theoretical advantages, few well-designed controlled      clinical trials have been conducted to establish efficacy and cost benefit. Furthermore,      projects to date have focused on special populations, e.g., heart failure or mental      illnesses. Since home telehealth may hold the most promise for individuals dealing with      multiple chronic illnesses, there is a need for population-based studies addressing the needs      of patients in primary care settings.      Care coordination, as defined by the VHA Office of Care Coordination, is a process of      assessment and ongoing monitoring of patients using home telehealth to proactively enable      prevention, investigation, and treatment that enhances the health of patients and prevents      unnecessary and inappropriate use of resources. Care coordination embeds technology into a      care management process. This results in the right care, at the right time, in the right      place.",C4553491;C0020538;C0011847;C1548341;C1550655;C1328956,C0011211;C0008679;C0011860;C1096775;C0009566;C0018801;C1552578;C0020538;C0278060;C0033137;C1328956;C1328956;C1328956;C0031809;C0150369;C1328956;C0199176;C0376636;C0087111;C0221423;C0087111;C0947630;C3245511;C0725694;C3245511;C0229992;C0562342;C1548341;C1273517;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C0520966;C0520966;C1550655;C1457887;C0542559;C4684637;C2911690;C0028079;C0013119;C1555709;C0015726;C0015726;C0683867;C0021141;C0449416;C1704289;C0332155;C0701928,0.0,0.0,0,41.0,20.5,0.002599034487236349,0.0025614049042750643,0,5
NCT01643434,Resistant Hypertension Optimal Treatment,"Resistant hypertension (ReHy) is an emerging clinical and public health problem which tends      to increase because populations are living longer and there is a growing global epidemic of      obesity, diabetes and sleep apnea. It is also tempting to speculate that the excessive      dietary salt ingestion reported in many countries can contribute substantially to the risk of      ReHy development. ReHy is defined as persistent high blood pressure (above the target goal)      in spite of the use of at least 3 antihypertensive agents of different classes, one of them      must being diuretics.      Data regarding the exact prevalence of ReHy are very limited. In addition, little data is      available about 3-drug combinations but a simplified treatment algorithm has demonstrated      that a combination of a diuretic plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or      an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) plus diuretic, adding a calcium channel blocker when      necessary, controlled 64% of hypertensive patients and, in addition, was even more efficient      than the current guideline-based management. By contrast, the fourth drug to be added-on the      triple regimen is still controversial and guided by empirical choices or personal      preferences. Recent studies suggest the emerging role of spironolactone as the ""first-line""      fourth drug for treating resistant hypertension. Conversely, because of the      pathophysiological rationale, others have proposed the use of β-blockers or even centrally      acting agents for managing the sympathetic hyperactivity. The present concerns about the      limited blood pressure reducing effect of β-blockers, especially in elderly people, the      potent effect of centrally acting agents and our personal experience are pointing to      clonidine as the fourth drug to be added-on to a multidrug combination for reaching optimal      blood pressure in patients with ReHy. Nevertheless, no studies have been performed comparing,      head-to-head, which one is the best fourth drug (spironolactone or clonidine) to be added-on      to a common used multidrug combination in order to treat this condition.      Therefore, the principal objectives of the ReHOT Trial are to assess prospectively: (1) the      prevalence of ReHy in a cohort of outpatients with stage II hypertension; (2) the effect of      spironolactone on blood pressure, in comparison to clonidine, when added to a multidrug      combination consisting of chlorthalidone plus ACEi (or ARB) plus amlodipine, all of 3      up-titrated to the highest dose; (3) the role of measuring sympathetic nervous system      activity and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity on predicting the response of blood      pressure to spironolactone and clonidine.",C0020538;C1514892;C0087111,C0003364;C0006684;C0020538;C0014432;C0037982;C0005823;C0005823;C0037982;C0037982;C0005823;C0008294;C0037982;C0699943;C0424295;C0020538;C3539181;C0857121;C0020538;C0020538;C0037315;C0243107;C0003018;C0003018;C0003018;C0002006;C0376636;C0237607;C0018017;C0051696;C1514892;C0012798;C0087111;C0002045;C0282423;C0009014;C0009014;C0012634;C0009014;C0009014;C0011849;C0700287;C0012798;C0012798;C1704632;C0460139;C0033213;C0028754;C0456387;C0040808;C0947630;C0150312;C0947630;C0027769;C3539125;C1518681;C1518681;C3245511;C1518681;C1300072;C0005767;C0037494;C0018017;C3245479;C0013227;C1704326;C0013227;C0013227;C0018670;C0018670;C0013227;C1273517;C1704326;C3539181;C3539181;C3539181;C3539181;C3845947;C4684637;C0776963;C1979715;C1514811;C2911690;C3653883;C1514892;C0449900;C0776963;C0776963;C0776963;C1522411;C0776963;C4697740;C0037816;C1707944;C3272565;C1707944;C1548344;C0201956;C4049938;C4049938;C3834249;C0277785;C0546816,0.0,0.0,0,7.0,3.5,0.0030660512790924195,0.003502615326949857,0,3

NCT02428075,Community-based Management of Hypertension in Nepal,"Hypertension contributes to significant burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in low and      middle-income countries; however responses to CVDs are inadequate particularly due to lack of      conclusive evidence on population based approach to hypertension control. This is a community      based cluster randomized trial involving family based health education through female      community health volunteers in Nepal. People ≥25 years of age and who are listed in the voter      list 2006 of Electoral Commission of Nepal who were either hypertensive, pre-hypertensive or      normotensive are eligible for eligible for participation in the study. A computer generated      random codes will be used to divide clusters into treatment and control arm. FCHVs will      conduct family based health education and blood pressure measurements in the treatment arm vs      not any interventions in control arm. Independent assessors will conduct the baseline and end      line assessment of the intervention. Intention to treat analysis and per protocol analysis      will be used in analysis to detect significant differences between treatment and control      group participants at baseline and follow up. Student t-tests for normally distributed      variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables will be used. In the event that      randomization do not control for differences between the treatment and control groups on      baseline characteristics, the investigators will statistically control for those differences      in subsequent analysis of program effects. The final outcome will be modeled by using      multiple linear regressions analysis. The investigators hope that if the intervention      outcomes shows positive effects in treatment arm, this approach can be adopted into the      existing health care delivery system in Nepal.

NCT00582777,African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension ABPM Pilot Study,"4. Methods 4a. Overview The study will be conducted in participants in the African-American      Study of Kidney Disease (AASK) Cohort study as a randomized three period cross-over trial.      Eighty five percent of AASK cohort participants are currently on an ACE inhibitor or      angiotensin receptor blocker; the most commonly used ACE inhibitor is ramipril. The new      strategies proposed in this pilot study will remain ramipril-based, to maintain the overall      blood pressure control achieved thus far.      The antihypertensive regimens proposed are as follows:        -  AM dosing of ramipril and other once daily medications in the participants           antihypertensive regimen (termed USUAL),        -  Bedtime dosing of ramipril and other once a day medications in the participant's           antihypertensive regimen (termed HS-DOSING), and        -  their current antihypertensive regimen plus an additional antihypertensive agent dosed           at bed time; the choice of the additional agent will be tailored based on prespecified           clinical guidelines (termed ADD-ON DOSING)      The ""usual arm"" serves as the comparator arm. The ""hs dosing"" and ""add-on dosing"" arms test      practical strategies that could be tested in a subsequent clinical outcomes trial and that      could be implemented in clinical practice. We hypothesize that both arms will reduce      nocturnal BP in comparison to ""usual dosing"". We further hypothesize that the ""hs dosing"" arm      will raise daytime BP somewhat but have no net effect on 24 hour BP and that the ""add on      dosing"" arm will have no effect on daytime BP but lower 24 hour BP.      This pilot study will begin after the last scheduled AASK Cohort study visit. Eligible      participants will be treated for 6 weeks on each of 3 antihypertensive regimens. The sequence      of the regimens will be random. Each period of the three periods will have 2 visits, one      visit at 3 weeks and one visit at 6 weeks. In the last week of each 6-week period, a 24-hour      ABPM will be obtained. The primary outcome variable is nocturnal BP; each pair wise      difference between the regimens will be calculated.",C0022658;C0020538;C0947630;C0947630,C0003364;C0003364;C0003364;C0003364;C0003364;C0003364;C0022658;C0005823;C0003015;C0003015;C0003018;C0013227;C0013227;C0679199;C0162791;C0679199;C0072973;C0072973;C2945654;C0072973;C0072973;C0237607;C2945654;C3853789;C2945654;C2945654;C0025663;C0040808;C0040808;C0040808;C0025344;C0025344;C0392366;C1518681;C1518681;C0025344;C0025344;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C1512346;C1512346;C1512346;C1273517;C0446516;C0392366;C0446516;C1561540;C1578513;C1561538;C0446516;C0446516;C0446516;C0446516;C0086960;C0085632;C1979715;C4553390;C0944988;C1512346;C0018792;C0018792;C0655359;C0814812;C3272565;C3272565;C3272565;C2984079;C4553760;C0332155,0.0,0.0,1,13.0,6.5,0.003083673751132471,0.0024833637979910267,0,2
NCT00440596,Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction for High Blood Pressure,"Nearly 60 million adults in the United States have high blood pressure (BP) in the      pre-hypertension (SBP 120-139 or DBP 80-89). Hypertension is estimated to account for 1 in 8      deaths in the world, and in the US the direct and indirect costs of high BP are estimated to      reach $59.7 billion in 2005. JNC-7 guidelines recommend lifestyle modifications for      prehypertension, followed by antihypertensive medication if BP progresses to Stage I      hypertension. Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an increasingly popular practice      that has been purported to alleviate stress and treat certain health conditions. Some stress      management therapies and one meditation therapy (e.g., Transcendental Meditation) have shown      promise in reducing elevated BP, but MBSR has not been evaluated as a treatment for high BP.      When added to lifestyle modification advice, MBSR may be an appropriate complementary      treatment for prehypertension. However, prior to a large randomized clinical trial of MBSR      for prehypertension and/or hypertension, pilot data is necessary to provide preliminary      evidence of a treatment effect and to evaluate feasibility. This feasibility randomized      clinical trial of MBSR for unmedicated prehypertension will provide preliminary evidence to      support a larger randomized clinical trial by evaluating the feasibility and safety of MBSR      as a complementary treatment for high BP and by documenting any treatment effect. Sixty      patients with unmedicated BP in the range of SBP 120-139 mm Hg or DBP 80-89 mm Hg will be      randomly assigned to MBSR or a progressive muscle relaxation control condition. All patients      will receive lifestyle modification advice. Patients will complete 8 weeks of MBSR delivered      in a group format by an experienced psychologist trained in MBSR or 8 weeks of progressive      muscle relaxation training matched for therapist contact and homework. Patients BP will be      assessed prior to randomization and following treatment by researchers blind to treatment      assignment. Accrual rates, acceptance of randomization, treatment adherence, treatment      fidelity, and patient satisfaction with treatment will be evaluated.",C0020538;C3542996;C1293152;C0038435,C0004361;C0150814;C0206034;C0206034;C0020538;C0282333;C0814263;C0003364;C1518681;C1518681;C1096775;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0242428;C3542996;C1301725;C0162791;C0013227;C0376636;C1293152;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0012634;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0237607;C1552601;C3245509;C0011065;C3244286;C0038435;C0038435;C0038435;C0150600;C0150600;C1301627;C1300072;C0456909;C3245479;C1306620;C1305849;C1306620;C1305849;C0237607;C2707291;C1696708;C1696708;C1696708;C1696708;C1550655;C1550655;C1555587;C1555587;C0080194;C3840684;C3840684;C0497247;C3840684;C1716046;C1716046;C3839460;C0220825;C0220825;C0776963;C4331837;C2702329;C1552839;C4331837;C0729829;C0308779;C0220825;C4283785;C0087130;C4698129;C0015730,0.0,0.0,1,22.0,22.0,0.0022520043011334907,0.002433088981478407,0,2
NCT01442883,Renal Nerve Ablation in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients,"~     In patients with treatment resistent hypertension renal nerve ablation emerged as an~     effective interventional approach of treating hypertensive disease with a progressively~     increasing fall in blood pressure. Decreased activity of the sympathetic nervous system is~     one of the major underlying pathogenetic mechanism of the fall in blood pressure but the~     precise mechanisms that causes the fall in blood pressure in the short-term and, in~     particular, long-term remains elusive. The objective of the study is to understand the~     pathogenetic mechanisms of renal denervation beyond the reduced activity of the sympathetic~     nervous system. In 100 hypertensive patients most advanced technology will be applied, before~     and repeatedly after renal denervation, throughout the follow-up period of 1 year. Systemic~     activity of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, renal perfusion (by MRI spin labelling~     technique), local activity of the renin angiotensin system in the kidney (urinary~     angiotensinogen concentrations), sodium excretion and total sodium content (23 Na-MRI~     technique) and vascular remodelling of small (retinal arterioles 50 - 150 µm) and large~     arteries (carotid - femoral pulse wave velocity and augmentation index, both measured over 24~     hours) will be assessed. Identification of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the fall~     in blood pressure after renal denervation may help to identify those hypertensive patients~     that profit most from renal nerve ablation in terms of blood pressure reduction.~      The investigators propose the following hypotheses why a progressive decrease in blood~     pressure happens, in addition to the decreased activity of the central nervous system, after~     renal nerve ablation:~      Short term effects:~      A)Preservation of renal function and perfusion B)Reduction of local RAS activity in the~     kidney C)Exaggerated sodium excretion immediately after renal nerve ablation~      Long term effects:~      D)Decrease of total sodium content after 6 and 12 months.

NCT02007629,Riociguat Clinical Effects Studied in Patients With Insufficient Treatment Response to Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitor,"~     BAY63-2521 Riociguat leads to the relaxation of smooth muscle cells in pulmonary arteria and~     may also inhibit abnormal remodeling of lung blood vessels. In patients with pulmonary~     arterial hypertension Riociguat showed to reduce the pulmonary blood pressure and improved~     the right heart function without unacceptable side effects. Here dose of Riociguat will be~     adjusted over 8 weeks then a Maintenance Phase of 16 weeks follows. Patients with Pulmonary~     Arterial Hypertension treated with stable doses of Phosphodiesterase Type-5 Inhibitors (Eg~     Sildenafil, Tadalafil) not appropriately responding to therapy will be included.

NCT00654862,Acute Hemodynamic Effects of Cocoa Polyphenols in Subjects With Hypertension and Optimal Blood Pressure,"~     Intake of cocoa-containing foods has been found to lower blood pressure (BP) in several~     clinical trials. It is supposed that the cocoa polyphenols represent the active principle,~     lowering BP by increasing the formation of vasodilative nitric oxide. However, direct~     evidence for this assumption from controlled clinical studies is lacking. Moreover, in~     hypertensive subjects vascular dilation appears to be impaired due to endothelial dysfunction~     and vascular smooth muscle remodeling, but it is unclear whether the BP response to cocoa~     phenols differs between subjects with high blood pressure and optimal blood pressure.~      The investigators hypothesized that (1) intake of cocoa phenols cause a dose-dependent, acute~     elevation of circulating bioactive NO levels and a reduction in BP, and that (2) the NO~     elevation and BP reduction are impaired in patients with hypertension.~      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized,~     placebo-controlled, double-blind, sample size-calculated, three-period crossover study with~     pre-planned statistical analysis and trial monitoring, in which cocoa phenols will be orally~     administered to subjects with mild essential hypertension or subjects with optimal blood~     pressure. The effects on blood pressure, heart rate, arterial function and plasma levels of~     cocoa phenols, circulating bioactive nitric oxide, and plasma markers of oxidative stress~     will be evaluated. After a 7-day cocoa-free run-in period and a 12-hour overnight fast, 48~     subjects (24 with hypertension and 24 sex-, and age (+/- 2yrs)-matched subjects with optimal~     blood pressure) will receive either a single dose of 1000 mg cocoa polyphenols, 250 mg cocoa~     phenols or placebo (in capsules of equal form and weight). Each intervention will be followed~     by a 7-day cocoa-free washout period before cross-over to the subsequent intervention.~     Subjects will be allocated to the intervention sequence by permuted block randomization (i.e.~     permuted blocks of 2 subjects with high BP and 2 subjects with optimal BP each, are assigned~     to permutations of the tree interventions). Measurements of hemodynamic and plasma parameters~     will be performed directly before and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 300, and 480 min after capsule~     administration. Included subjects will be counseled to maintain their usual diet and physical~     activity and to abstain from all cocoa products during the study.

NCT01776216,Impact of Dairy Consumption on Hypertension: a Clinical Study,"Hypertension and endothelial dysfunction are being increasingly recognized as key etiological      factors in the development of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD). A      substantial body of evidence indicates that treating patients with elevated blood pressure      (BP) leads to marked reduction in the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure,      and renal failure. There is also accumulating evidence associating endothelial dysfunction,      which is defined as incapacity of the arteries to vasodilate when required, to elevated BP      and an increased risk of CVD.      While there are more and more studies on how diet affects BP in healthy subjects, the impact      of dairy consumption per se on both endothelial function and ambulatory BP has not been well      characterized in patients with established essential hypertension. Therefore, the general      objective of the study is to investigate in a single-blind randomized controlled study the      impact of dairy consumption on ambulatory BP and endothelial function in subjects with mild      to moderate essential hypertension.",C0020538;C1947907;C3272565;C0947630,C0856169;C0497247;C0856169;C0007222;C0085580;C0085580;C0027051;C0004153;C0018801;C0035078;C0020538;C0243107;C1561560;C1561560;C4551656;C0018017;C0003842;C3245501;C0031843;C0031843;C0947630;C0038454;C0087136;C0947630;C0456909;C0947630;C4699158;C0497247;C1947907;C1947907;C4684637;C0001721;C0282440;C1328018;C1547226;C1548762;C0042402;C0181622,0.0,0.0,0,7.0,7.0,0.002609558988439207,0.0021607172112922414,0,2
NCT03588520,Home Blood Pressure (HBP)-Guided Management of Hypertension in Stage 3-4 CKD,"~     It is estimated that over 25% of the world's population had hypertension in the year 2000 and~     that this proportion will reach 30% in the year 2025. With the introduction of the 2017~     Guideline for High Blood Pressure in Adults from the American College of Cardiology and the~     American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines, the definition of~     hypertension became broader and as a result the prevalence is expected to further increase.~     On the other hand, it is estimated that around 10% of the world's population is affected by~     chronic kidney disease (CKD) with hypertension being both cause and complication of CKD.~      It is obvious that hypertension and CKD are interconnected and are both major risk factors~     for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertension results in increased CVD risk both directly,~     as an independent factor, and indirectly via its negative impact on renal function. In fact,~     the deterioration of the renal function is proportional to the degree of hypertension. On the~     other hand, the more advanced the CKD is, the more challenging the management of hypertension~     becomes, as patients with CKD present altered patterns of blood pressure (BP) during the day~     and, additionally, the prevalence of white coat and masked hypertension is significantly~     higher in this group of patients.~      To date, hypertensive patients are treated according to the BP recordings that are obtained~     in the office (OBP) during routine patient visits, which leads to inaccurate estimates of the~     true burden of hypertension and also affects the efficacy of the therapeutic intervention. It~     has been suggested that self measured BP (HBP) is a more accurate estimate of the patients'~     daytime BP compared to the conventional office BP measurements. This has been already~     confirmed in studies regarding the general population and it has been suggested that the same~     applies to the patients with CKD. This study aims to check the validity of this hypothesis by~     comparing the effect of the HBP - guided management versus the conventional OBP - guided~     management on the 24 hour ambulatory BP monitoring of patients with uncontrolled hypertension~     and CKD stage 3 and 4.~   ",C0005823;C0020538,C0808232;C0005823;C3887460;C0005823;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0162791;C1704788;C0205160;C0012634;C0012634;C0150312;C0022646;C0018787;C0441722;C0018563;C0018563;C1512346;C0035648;C0020538;C0020538;C0004083;C0162791;C1330542;C2986419;C0009566;C1330542;C1330542;C1330542;C0011546,0.0,0.0,-1,0.0,0.0,0.004267014876333815,0.002094047077900773,0,2
NCT03775096,Adrenergic Blockers for Cardiac Changes in Early Parkinson's Disease,"~     REM Behavior Sleep Disorder (RBD) is a sleep disorder causing people to 'act out' their~     dreams. A high percentage of individuals with idiopathic RBD (iRBD) are known to develop~     conditions affecting the neurons in the brain such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Based on the~     increased risk to develop PD, individuals with iRBD are currently considered ideal candidates~     for therapies that can possibly protects brain cells, due to the critical window of~     opportunity to intervene early before brain cell loss progresses significantly.~      Early changes of PD are associated with a number of symptoms including loss of smell,~     constipation, anxiety and depression. In addition, early heart and brain abnormalities can be~     visualized using specialized imaging techniques called 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy~     (MIBG) and dopamine transporter (DAT) single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT)~     respectively. The combined presence of certain symptoms and the use of these imaging~     techniques are considered early markers of PD in individuals with iRBD.~      In other conditions, like heart failure, MIBG abnormalities are reversed by drugs able to~     block excessive adrenergic stimulation, known as beta-blockers. In this study the~     investigators want to learn about the effect of treatment with the beta-blocker carvedilol on~     MIBG abnormalities found in iRBD patients at risk to develop PD. The investigators believe~     that reversing the MIBG abnormality might prelude to a slowing of the neurodegenerative~     process. This drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for congestive~     heart failure, hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction.~     However, carvedilol is not approved by the FDA in patients with iRBD at risk for PD. The~     available doses for this drug oral formulations are 3.125mg, 6.25mg, 12.5mg and 25mg.~      Changes visualized with the MIBG imaging technique will be correlated to the presence and~     severity of neurological (i.e. tremors, stiffness, slow movements, walking difficulties) and~     other symptoms associated with PD (i.e. abnormal smell, constipation, depression, color~     vision abnormalities), as measured by specific clinical scales and exams.~   ",C0012634,C0079595;C0018801;C0018801;C0009806;C0020538;C0009806;C1704258;C0011570;C0040395;C0011570;C0427008;C1457887;C0013030;C1457887;C1457887;C0205161;C0012634;C0003467;C1522240;C0013117;C0042789;C0222045;C0037313;C0037313;C0006104;C0006104;C0006104;C0018787;C0006104;C3687832;C0079595;C0027051;C0026649;C0544452;C0040822;C0723338;C1536055;C1273070;C0332149;C0376495,0.0,0.0,-1,0.0,0.0,0.0014301771187106619,0.0017961171222336664,0,2

NCT00978926,A Study of the Pharmacodynamic Effects of Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Therapy in Patients With Advanced Malignancies,"~     The well-established role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in carcinogenesis and~     tumor angiogenesis has led to the development of agents that target this pathway. Anti-VEGF~     agents the VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, and the small molecule VEGF receptor~     tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Angiogenic factors play a key role in the maintenance of lung~     integrity and normal endothelial function. Endothelial dysfunction has been implicated in~     hypertension, proteinuria and retinopathy. One of the major issues of anti-VEGF agents is its~     long-term toxicity especially taking into account the lack of adequate knowledge in this area~     and the possibility of prolonged periods of therapy in non-progressing patients. Hypertension~     and proteinuria are commonly seen in patients treated with anti-VEGF agents. In addition, the~     investigators have also observed in a relatively high frequency of pulmonary air-filled~     lesions in patients with malignancy in the lung treated with an anti-VEGF agent. Objectives~     of this exploratory study are to 1) determine the effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth~     factor (VEGF) on endothelial function 2) determine endothelial dysfunction as a marker of~     early response and as an indicator for the development of hypertension and proteinuria 3)~     characterize the effect of anti-VEGF therapy on the pulmonary function of patients with~     malignancy (primary or secondary) involving the lung in patients treated with anti-VEGF~     agents. Pharmacodynamic endpoints to be assessed are: blood pressure, brachial artery~     reactivity, retinal microvessels, microalbuminuria and proteinuria, pulmonary function,~     assess the effects of anti-VEGF therapy by assessing brachial artery reactivity, retinal~     vasculature and pulmonary function in a subset of patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy. The~     development of markers of endothelial dysfunction may result in the early identification of~     patients who are non-responders or develop toxicity from anti-VEGF treatment.~   ",C0018270,C1519670;C1998726;C0730345;C0596263;C0005823;C0020792;C0020538;C0020538;C0796392;C0033687;C0033687;C0033687;C0033687;C4282132;C4282132;C0041485;C0018270;C0024109;C0024109;C3536832;C3537035;C0020538;C0021212;C0281019;C0221198;C0018270;C0035298;C0024119;C0024119,0.0,0.0,-1,0.0,0.0,0.00047215782198051394,0.0015435630864550891,0,2

It~     consists of 3 phases: screening, treatment and follow-up. During the screening visit, the~     study doctor will decide if patients meet the study requirements. All potential patients will~     have a diagnosis of increased pulmonary artery pressures that is shown by right heart~     catheterization conducted shortly prior to start of study treatment.

NCT02554487,Early Sleep Apnea Treatment in Stroke,"~     Investigating the interrelation of stroke and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is of major~     importance. First because of the high occurrence rate of stroke and the fact that it is a~     frequent cause of long-term disability in adulthood. Second because SDB (obstructive, central~     and mixed forms) affects more than 50% of stroke survivors and has a detrimental effect on~     clinical stroke outcome. Third, spontaneous and learning-dependent sleep-associated~     neuroplasticity may be affected by SDB following stroke worsening stroke rehabilitation.~     Therefore, it is crucial to investigate whether early treatment of SDB with Adaptive~     Servo-Ventilation (ASV), the treatment device of choice to treat obstructive, central and~     mixed forms of SDB, has a beneficial effect on the evolution of the lesion volume and on~     clinical stroke outcome.~      To this end, the investigators recruit and prospectively follow 3 groups of patients with~     ischemic stroke over 1 year. During the first night after hospital admission due to acute~     stroke, nocturnal breathing is assessed by means of a respiratory polygraphy. Patients with~     significant sleep disordered breathing, defined as an Apnea-Hypopnea-Index (AHI) > 20/h, are~     randomized to ASV treatment or no treatment (sSDB ASV+ or sSDB ASV-). ASV treatment starts~     the second night following hospital admission and ends 90 days later. Stroke patients without~     SDB (AHI < 5 / h) serve as a control group (no SDB) to observe the evolution of the lesion~     volume and stroke outcome without the additional burden of SDB.~      Lesion volume one day after hospital admission due to acute stroke (after potential lysis~     therapy) measured by Diffusion Weighted Imaging will be subtracted from lesion volume~     measured by T2-weighted volumetry assessed 90(+/-7) days following stroke and compared~     between patients with and without ASV treatment (sSDB ASV+ and sSDB ASV-) as well as patients~     without SDB (no SDB). Short- and long-term clinical stroke outcomes are assessed by clinical~     scales and questionnaires 4 to 7 days, 3 months and 1 year following stroke. Cognitive~     outcome is assessed during hospitalization (within the first week following stroke) and after~     the treatment period of 90 days by neuropsychological tests assessing attention and memory.~     In addition, baseline assessment of physiological parameters such as blood pressure and~     endothelial function/arterial stiffness are assessed during the first weeks following stroke~     and at the end of the treatment period, i.e. approximately 90 days following stroke.~   ",C0037315;C0038454;C0376495,C0598801;C0184666;C0184666;C0184666;C0948008;C0019993;C0034394;C0005823;C0004268;C0427008;C0023185;C0235546;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0221198;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0221198;C0038454;C0221198;C0038454;C0038454;C0222045;C0038454;C0038454;C0037313;C0037313;C0037313;C0003578;C0918012;C2948499;C2948499;C0221198;C0038454;C0024348;C2598130;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495,0.0,0.0,-1,0.0,0.0,0.001490902814451851,0.000990555211207135,0,2
NCT00099476,Effects of Dark Chocolate on Insulin Sensitivity in People With High Blood Pressure,"This study will examine whether dark chocolate affects the way patients with hypertension      (high blood pressure) respond to insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas that regulates      blood glucose (sugar) levels. In many people with hypertension, insulin is not as effective      in helping the body use glucose. This is called insulin resistance. Insulin also increases      blood flow into muscle by opening inactive blood vessels. Laboratory studies suggest that      eating dark chocolate may improve blood pressure. This study will determine whether dark      chocolate improves insulin resistance or changes how blood vessels react to insulin in      hypertensive people.      People between 21 and 65 years of age who have high blood pressure and are not pregnant may      be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical      examination, and blood and urine tests.      Participants refrain from eating foods containing chocolate or cocoa for 1 week and then come      to the clinic on three separate occasions 3 weeks apart for a glucose clamp test and contrast      ultrasound, described below. At the first glucose clamp test, subjects are randomly assigned      to drink either a cocoa drink with high anti-oxidant content or one with a very low content      of anti-oxidant. Each drink will be taken twice a day for 2 weeks. At the end of the 2 weeks,      they return for a second glucose clamp test. At the second test, they stop taking the cocoa      drink for 1 week and then start again for another 2 weeks. For this 2-week period, those who      were given the high anti-oxidant content cocoa drink the first 2 weeks will take the placebo,      very low anti-oxidant drink this time, and those who took the placebo will now have the high      anti-oxidant cocoa drink. After this 2 weeks of taking the cocoa drink or placebo, they then      take the third and last glucose clamp test.      Glucose clamp test: This test measures how the body responds to insulin. Subjects fast the      night before each test and do not eat until the test is over, usually in the early afternoon.      For the test, the subject lies in a bed or reclines in a chair.

NCT02019823,Effectiveness of SMS-text Message Support for Patients With Hypertension to Improve Blood Pressure,"General synopsis for SMS-text Adherence Support (*StAR) Study and associated preparatory and      pilot work      Background: High blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, stroke and      chronic kidney disease. Clear evidence exists that for individuals with high blood pressure      (hypertension) lowering blood pressure really reduces this risk. One of the critical factors      in the long term control of blood pressure is the regular use of effective antihypertensive      medications. In South Africa, poor treatment adherence (attending clinic, re-filling      prescriptions, and regularly taking hypertension tablets) is known to be an important and      alterable risk factor for uncontrolled high blood pressure and its complications (heart      disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease). SMS-text messages have been shown to improve      clinic attendance and medication adherence for some diseases (like HIV and TB) in other      low-resource settings. It is not clear whether SMS-text messages to support treatment      adherence have an effect on long-term blood pressure control. The acceptability,      sustainability and scalability such technology also remains to be determined.      Aim: To investigate if a system of SMS-text messages to support treatment adherence is more      effective than usual care for controlling high blood-pressure.      Objectives: The main objective is to test whether advice and support given by SMS-text,      either by providing information (informational) or by allowing a two-way communication      (interactive) improves control of blood pressure at one year compared to usual care.      Additional objectives include assessing whether the interventions have an effect on,        -  Clinic attendance        -  Prescription refill adherence        -  Self-reported medication adherence        -  Hypertension related illness or death        -  Patient empowerment      Study design: Single centre randomized three-arm parallel group trial As it is not clear how      best to support treatment adherence for people with hypertension we need to compare the      different ways this might be done. Eligible patients who provide written consent will be put      into one of three groups and then compared. The groups are selected by a computer which has      no information about the individual (i.e. by chance). Participants in each group will get      different types of SMS-text messages and these are compared.      Study interventions:        -  Enhanced usual care In addition to their usual clinical care participants will receive           the pre-randomisation ""Welcome to the *StAR Study"" SMS-text, a ""Happy Birthday"" SMS-text           on their date of birth and up to six additional SMS-text messages containing study           specific information and thanking the participant for taking part in the study.        -  Informational SMS-text messages In addition to enhanced usual care, participants           allocated to the informational SMS-text support group will receive semi-tailored           structured adherence-support (including clinic appointment and medication pick-up           reminders, medication adherence support and hypertension-related education.)        -  Interactive SMS-text messages In addition to enhanced usual care and informational           SMS-text messages, SMS-text messages sent to participants in the interactive SMS-text           group will contain a ""prompt to respond"" which will guide participants to additional           SMS-text based resources.      Outcome measures: The main outcome measure is mean blood pressure measured at one year.      Additional outcomes include the proportion of participants with ""controlled blood pressure""      as well as measures of clinic attendance, prescription refill adherence, self-reported      medication adherence, hypertension related illness or death, and patient empowerment.",C0005823;C4553491;C0020538;C0470166;C1171411;C1527021;C1550655;C0184511,C1753303;C1753303;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0428886;C0149761;C0003364;C0022658;C0005823;C0022658;C0005823;C0005823;C0018799;C0033080;C0009566;C3242430;C0886296;C0886296;C0421451;C3242430;C3242430;C0020538;C0020538;C0033080;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0035648;C0013227;C0035648;C0013227;C0018017;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0018017;C0087111;C0424927;C2348629;C0470166;C0012634;C0470166;C0470166;C0460139;C0700287;C0470166;C0470166;C1552740;C0470166;C0470166;C0470166;C0470166;C0700287;C3812897;C1171411;C0012634;C0221423;C1550655;C0221423;C0038454;C0038454;C1518681;C0150600;C1518681;C1549113;C1552839;C1552839;C0947630;C1709157;C0018787;C0005767;C3244317;C0011065;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0018592;C0947630;C0947630;C0011065;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C0392366;C1527021;C1561543;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1561543;C1551994;C1550472;C2948600;C0446516;C0018017;C1820370;C3242430;C0542559;C0184511;C1555587;C3242430;C3242430;C3242430;C4082977;C0233492;C0233492;C0233492;C4693928;C2911690;C0870427;C4084912;C4084912;C0699530;C0011167;C1552839;C0018792;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C3242613;C0449416;C1547298;C0184511;C4554418;C3272565;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129,0.0,0.0,1,51.0,12.75,0.00302402500955686,0.004001269055242211,0,1

NCT01995812,Ola Hou i ka Hula: Hula and Hypertension,"Physical activity is an important lifestyle modification for individuals with high blood      pressure. It is part of national cardiac care guidelines for hypertension management that      recommends, along with prescribing medication, lifestyle modification be promoted for      improved dietary intake, and participation in about 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.      Native Hawaiians and other Pacific peoples (NHPP) have among the highest risk for the heart      disease, with mortality rates twice other ethnic groups. In many minority populations,      including NHPP, hypertension develops at an early age, is more severe and is less likely to      be controlled. Despite the ability of physical activity to reduce blood pressure, the      majority of U.S. population, do not meet physical activity recommendations and new      interventions that can improve accessibility and adherence, particularly among at-risk      minority populations are needed.      In this research, Hypertension and Hula: Ola Hou Pilot Study, we plan to evaluate a      culturally relevant intervention that uses hula and is consistent with the goals of      recommended physical activity for improved lifestyle - moderate-intensity, prolonged physical      activity cumulatively at about 150 minutes per week. Hula, the traditional dance form of      Native Hawaiians, is commonly practiced in Hawai'i as a cultural practice, form of creative      expression, and exercise that is structured on controlled, rhythmic movements. Combining      aspects of meditation, music, self-awareness with low-impact aerobic exercise, traditional      hula may be particularly suitable to individuals with limited mobility and fitness and within      the recommended paradigm for exercise training and secondary prevention of coronary artery      disease (CAD). We anticipate a hula and heart health education program will be particularly      appealing to Native Hawaiians and other Pacific people (NHPP) including Pacific Islanders and      Filipino who suffer from a significant disparity in cardiovascular health.      Specifically, we will determine if individuals with poorly managed hypertension and      randomized to a 12-week hula and heart health education intervention will demonstrate better      blood pressure levels, functional capacity, and exercise tolerance (6-minute walk test) than      individuals randomized to a usual care group. We will also assess if the individuals in the      hula intervention report better health-related quality of life, stress management,      perceptions of discrimination, and exercise self efficacy.",C0020538,C0679699;C1998319;C0162521;C0430515;C0150788;C0001701;C0700572;C0205042;C0518214;C1286104;C0005823;C3146223;C3887460;C0005823;C0012632;C0886296;C0600564;C0150158;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0184661;C0020538;C0184661;C0184661;C0278329;C0030971;C0162791;C0376636;C0013227;C0185117;C0150277;C0424927;C0424927;C0031809;C0460139;C0184511;C0184511;C0237607;C0012634;C0012634;C0680174;C1552839;C0205082;C0332148;C0683278;C0684224;C0005767;C0018787;C0947630;C0018017;C0026867;C0018787;C0018787;C1561540;C1561540;C1578513;C1550472;C0454330;C0454330;C0237607;C0452240;C0452240;C0442694;C0016095;C0184511;C3840684;C3840684;C0040399;C0233492;C2911690;C2911690;C0178520;C0178520;C0178520;C4084912;C0026649;C4699552;C0729829;C1552839;C0030851;C4049938;C3854058;C1547226;C0220825;C1547226;C0031809;C4049938;C0886384;C0886384;C3840775;C4698129;C0151872;C4082977,0.0,0.0,0,7.0,7.0,0.006691716720799265,0.0034264593243604788,0,1
NCT01295216,Use of Mobile Technology to Prevent Progression of Pre-hypertension in Latin American Urban Settings,"Nearly half of the adult population in Latin American urban settings has abnormally high      blood pressure. Although half of these subjects with high blood pressure are still in the      pre-hypertensive stage (systolic blood pressure values in the 120-139 mmHg range or diastolic      blood pressure in the 80-89 mmHg range), the rate of progression to hypertension is high      (10-20% per year), according to studies done in other settings. The main objective of this      proposal is to evaluate the effectiveness of an affordable and sustainable primary health      care intervention to reduce blood pressure and prevent progression from pre-hypertensive      status to hypertension in individuals at poor urban clinics in Argentina, Guatemala, and      Peru. Our primary hypotheses are that pre-hypertensive subjects who receive mHealth (mobile      health) support for 12 months (intervention group) will have lower blood pressure compared to      individuals who receive the usual primary health care (control group); and that      pre-hypertensive subjects will maintain lower blood pressure six months after receiving      mHealth support. The investigators will determine the effects of an intervention using      mHealth technology, including short message services (SMS) and one-to-one telephone calls, to      promote lifestyle modification focused on reducing blood pressure among participants. The      intervention also aims to help participants become better informed, motivated, and encouraged      to practice self-management of their own health; to improve patient satisfaction levels;      provide tailored targeted interventions; and to improve patient-provider relationships. The      proposal is designed as a proof-of-concept intervention in three Latin American countries      that encompass a wide range of environments and health care settings. A total of 212 subjects      (30-60 years old) per country will be recruited in primary health clinics and randomized to      study groups. Blood pressure, anthropometry, and behavioral risk factors (physical activity,      diet, stress, alcohol and tobacco use) will be measured at baseline and at months 6 and 12      during the intervention, and six months after the end of the intervention.

NCT01276951,Controlled Clinical Trial to Determine the Effective Dose of Cocoa in Lowering Blood Pressure,"~     In Colombia, ischemic heart disease and stroke are one of the most important causes of death~     in 45 years old people. Care of cases of disease represents high costs for the health system~     in particular and society in general, due to the loss of productive years life and costs for~     the care of the aftermath. Hypertension (HT) is one of the preventable risk factors for major~     cerebrovascular disorders. The pathophysiology of Essential hypertension is complex and~     depends of interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Among the determining elements~     are the increase in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, the vasoconstricting and~     overproduction of hormones associated with sodium retention, disruption in renin secretion~     with increased production of aldosterone and angiotensin II, the deregulation of the kinins~     system, the increase in peripheral vascular resistance and activity of Growth factors in~     atherogenesis and vascular endothelial dysfunction, increased cardiac output, diabetes~     mellitus, obesity, and lower production of vasodilators such as brain natriuretic peptide~     (BNP), the prostacyclins and nitric oxide (NO), among others.~      Cocoa is a food rich in flavonoids, which stimulate the enzyme activity of endothelial nitric~     oxide synthase (e-NOS), responsible of the production of NO in vascular smooth muscle.

NCT01465217,Text Messaging to Improve Hypertension Medication Adherence in African Americans,"Uncontrolled high blood pressure (HBP) is a major public health concern and leading cause of      cardiovascular disease worldwide. The HBP crisis is particularly onerous to African Americans      as they are disproportionately more susceptible to HBP than non-Hispanic White Americans.      Poor adherence to prescribed medication regimens is a major problem, as only about half of      patients who have been diagnosed with hypertension adhere to prescribed medications. Mobile      phones and text messages are becoming widely integrated into routine daily life and may offer      a simple and non-labor intensive strategy for improving the quality of medication management      through enhancing medication adherence. This proposed research will be conducted in two      distinct phases addressing three specific aims. For Specific Aim 1 (Phase I), the      investigators propose to conduct focus groups with participants from the investigators target      population in order to obtain feedback to guide the development of a mobile phone text      message system that seeks to improve adherence to antihypertensive medications. For Specific      Aim 2 (Phase II), the investigators propose to pilot test the newly developed text message      intervention with a randomized controlled trial. For Specific Aim 3 (Phase II), the      investigators propose to ascertain participant perceptions of intervention effectiveness and      satisfaction in order to guide further system refinement. In Phase I, African Americans with      uncontrolled hypertension (n=24-32) will be recruited to take part in one of four focus      groups that will help guide the development of the text message intervention. In Phase II,      African Americans with uncontrolled hypertension will be randomized to receive usual care      (n=30) vs. the text message intervention (n=30). The primary outcome in this pilot will be      change in medication adherence at one month follow-up; secondary outcomes include change in      medication self-efficacy and systolic and diastolic blood pressure at one month follow-up, as      well as participant satisfaction with the text message intervention. The proposed research      will utilize the Wayne State University (WSU) Center for Urban Studies to conduct high      quality and professionally run focus groups, the WSU Division of Computing and Information      Technology's Broadcast Message Service infrastructure for the delivery of text messages, the      WSU Center for Health Research for statistical analysis and grant management assistance, and      a diverse study team from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds at WSU.

NCT02900729,Randomized Controlled Trial of Renal Denervation for Resistant Hypertension,"Hypertension represents a significant global public health problem, contributing to vascular      and renal morbidity, cardiovascular mortality, and economic burden. For a mostly asymptomatic      disease, there is a huge challenge to maintain a good adherence and longtime persistence of      drug use so as to adequately control it. Even so, a significant proportion of patients will      develop resistant hypertension. In recent years, renal denervation has been argued as an      effective means to address blood pressure problem in several non-Chinese clinical trials. The      technique is to deliver low level radiofrequency energy through the renal artery wall to      target the sympathetic nervous system and then modulate blood pressure.

NCT01761916,Clonidine Versus Captopril for Treatment of Postpartum Very High Blood Pressure,"The postpartum period represents a stage of the pregnancy-puerperal still rarely addressed      scientifically. There are no reports in the literature and concrete enough to elucidate      important issues, especially in the field of hypertension and pregnancy.      Searches based on current evidence concentrate their focus on the diagnosis of hypertensive      disorders and treatment of these diseases maternofetais repercussions. However, the prognosis      in the short and long term, as the BP outcome in mothers with severe preeclampsia, the most      effective treatment for the control of hypertensive crisis and metabolic and cardiovascular      events after two years of termination of pregnancy require further clarification.      The main idea for developing this research came from the clinical experience with the use of      captopril in Obstetric ICU IMIP. This drug has long been used in postpartum women with severe      preeclampsia or chronic hypertension exacerbated by pregnancy for control of hypertensive      crisis and keeping pressure levels. Following the technical standards of the institution and      during his administration, there were reports of side effects such as dry cough and nausea,      beyond the threshold dose of 150mg daily captopril was easily achieved hindering control the      use of hypotensive.      Alternative therapy, clonidine began to be used in mothers with some restriction on the use      of ACE inhibitors and its hypotensive effect for peak pressure was satisfactory. What is not      known yet is how long clonidine reduces high blood pressure and how long to leave stabilized      compared to the use of captopril.      There are no reports in the literature databases, no randomized clinical trials that prove      the effectiveness of clonidine for the treatment of hypotensive pressure peaks in this      particular group of patients, even in comparison with other classes of antihypertensive      drugs, especially captopril, to this purpose.

NCT01794052,To Develop a High Quality Health Care Delivery Model for the Management of Hypertension and Diabetes at CHCs and District Hospitals of Himachal Pradesh.,"Hypertension and diabetes are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Although these      two conditions can be detected much early in life and are amenable to interventions at      primary health care level, the health system in India fails to provide adequate interventions      at primary health care level which translates to huge burden of undiagnosed and uncontrolled      hypertension and diabetes in the community. This study aims to design a feasible and      sustainable evidence-based, decision support-enabled, health care delivery model for the      management of hypertension and diabetes in the primary health care facilities of Himachal      Pradesh. The study will be conducted at the 5 Community Health Centers (CHCs) and District      Hospital of Solan District, Himachal Pradesh using both qualitative and quantitative methods.      The design and development of the model will be carried out in the initial six months      followed by piloting the services at the CHCs and District Hospital.

NCT00360087,A Study of Patients Having Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Sickle Cell Disease and Completing an ASSET Study,"~     This study will assess the safety and efficacy of bosentan therapy (in a study known as~     ASSET) for patients who have high blood pressure in the lungs associated with sickle cell~     disease. That form of hypertension places people at risk for complications, including~     shortness of breath, pain, pneumonia, and death. Previous studies have shown that bosentan~     can be helpful in reducing pulmonary hypertension.~      Patients ages 16 and older who have completed the 16-week treatment in the ASSET 1 or ASSET 2~     study and who are not pregnant or breastfeeding may be eligible for this study. The research~     will be conducted in about 25 hospitals in the United States and Europe. Up to 30~     participants will be enrolled. The screening visit will involve a physical examination, blood~     sample of about 3 teaspoons for laboratory tests, and a pregnancy test. Patients' doctors~     will give them bosentan tablets (62.5 mg each), to take one in the morning and one in the~     evening. After 1 month, patients will be told whether the dose should be increased to 125 mg~     tablets to take twice a day. Two weeks after the increase in dose, a blood test will be done~     to analyze the drug's effects on the liver. After the start of treatment, patients will~     return for visits every 6 months, when there will be a 6-minute walking test to measure~     exercise capacity and evaluate shortness of breath. There will be follow-up for patients up~     to the end of the study and for 28 days after the last dose of bosentan is taken, to collect~     information about side effects.~      Some patients on bosentan have had changes in liver function and red blood cell count. Side~     effects commonly reported are headache, flushed appearance, inflammation of the throat and~     nasal passages, and gastrointestinal symptoms. If patients have sudden worsening in breathing~     in the first few weeks after taking bosentan, they should immediately tell their doctors,~     because it may be necessary to change the treatment.~   ",C0020542;C0012634,C0031809;C0005771;C0005823;C0020538;C0021368;C0032285;C1710032;C0032961;C0018681;C1457887;C0012634;C3665375;C0005767;C0023884;C0023884;C0030193;C0020542;C0009566;C0596601;C0005767;C0376495;C0376495,0.0,0.0,-1,47.0,47.0,0.0015997732642611554,0.0021394739182169467,0,1

NCT01647945,FK506 (Tacrolimus) in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,"Mutations in bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) are present in >80% of familial      and ~20% of sporadic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients. Furthermore      dysfunctional BMP signaling is a general feature of pulmonary hypertension even in      non-familial PAH.      We therefore hypothesized that increasing BMP signaling might prevent and reverse the      disease. We screened > 3500 FDA approved drugs for their propensity to increase BMP signaling      and found FK506 (Tacrolimus) to be a strong activator of BMP signaling. Tacrolimus restored      normal function of pulmonary artery endothelial cells, prevented and reversed experimental      PAH in mice and rats.      Given that Tacrolimus is already FDA approved with a known side-effect profile, it is an      ideal candidate drug to use in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.      The aims of our trial are:        1. Establish the Safety of FK506 in patients with PAH.        2. Evaluate the Efficacy of FK506 in PAH        3.

NCT01844596,Optimizing Linkage and Retention to Hypertension Care in Rural Kenya,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa among adults      above age 30. The prevalence of hypertension, a major risk factor for CVD, is increasing over      time in sub-Saharan Africa, exerting a significant epidemiologic and economic burden on the      region. Without adequate control of hypertension, its health and economic burden will      increase drastically in the decades ahead. Well established and evidence-based interventions      to manage hypertension exist; however, treatment and control rates are low.      A critical component of hypertension management is to facilitate sustained access of affected      individuals to effective clinical services. In partnership with the Government of Kenya, the      United States Agency for International Development-Academic Model Providing Access to      Healthcare Partnership (AMPATH) is expanding its clinical scope of work in rural western      Kenya to include hypertension and other chronic diseases.      However, linking and retaining individuals with elevated blood pressure to the clinical care      program has been difficult. Thus, the overall objective of this application is to utilize a      multi-disciplinary implementation research approach to address the challenge of linking and      retaining hypertensive individuals to a hypertension management program.

NCT02191111,A Cluster-randomized Controlled Knowledge Translation Feasibility Study in Alberta Community Pharmacies,"~     Background: Despite evidence of benefit for pharmacist involvement in chronic disease~     management, the provision of these services in community pharmacy has been suboptimal. The~     Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework suggests~     that for knowledge translation to be effective, there must be evidence of benefit, a context~     conducive to implementation, and facilitation to support uptake. We hypothesize that while~     the evidence and context components of this framework are satisfied, that uptake into~     practice has been insufficient because of a lack of facilitation. This protocol describes the~     rationale and methods of a feasibility study to test a facilitated pharmacy practice~     intervention based on the PARiHS framework, to assist community pharmacists in increasing the~     number of formal and documented medication management services completed for patients with~     diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.~      Methods: A cluster-randomized before-after design will compare ten pharmacies from within a~     single organization, with the unit of randomization being the pharmacy. Pharmacies will be~     randomized to facilitated intervention based on the PARiHS framework or usual practice. The~     Alberta Context Tool will be used to establish the context of practice in each pharmacy.~     Pharmacies randomized to the intervention will receive task-focused facilitation from an~     external facilitator, with the goal of developing alternative team processes to allow the~     greater provision of medication management services for patients with diabetes, hypertension,~     and dyslipidemia. The primary outcome will be a process evaluation of the needs of community~     pharmacies to provide more clinical services, the acceptability and uptake of modifications~     made, and the willingness of pharmacies to participate. Secondary outcomes will include the~     change in the number of formal and documented medication management services in the~     aforementioned chronic conditions provided 6 months before, versus after, the intervention~     between the two groups, and identification of feasible quantitative outcomes for evaluating~     the effect of the intervention on patient care outcomes.~      Results: To date, the study has identified and enrolled the ten pharmacies required and~     initiated the intervention process.~      Conclusion: This study will be the first to examine the role of facilitation in pharmacy~     practice, with the goal of scalable and sustainable practice change.~   ",C0376554;C0180112,C0150270;C0150270;C0150270;C1704289;C0020792;C0017313;C1301725;C0220825;C1301725;C0376554;C4084799;C0011847;C0011847;C0025663;C0025663;C1522240;C0243144;C0243144;C0243144;C0008679;C0020538;C0020538;C3840684;C0332128;C0723338;C0600091;C1522240;C1522240,0.0,0.0,-1,5.0,2.5,0.0005856720768220978,0.0016471207846436755,0,1

NCT02283047,Effects of Different Aerobic Exercise Programs With Nutritional Interventions in Hypertensive and Overweight People,"~     Obesity and arterial hypertension (HTN) frequently coexist in the same patient. Moreover, the~     concept that obesity and HTN can be additive in terms of cardiovascular rist is widely~     accepted. Yet, clinical decision-making in obese patients is complicated by a surprising lack~     of evidence on the relative importance of obesity and HTN treatment and its efficacy and~     safety. Lifestyle interventions are the mainstay of obesity management programs and are also~     advocated in the prevention and treatment of HTN. Physical exercise and diet are recommended~     to prevent and control obesity and HTN. Aerobic exercise is firmly established as an~     effective measure for lowering blood pressure and reducing cardiovascular risk. However,~     there is no agreement about the optimal dose of frequency, intensity, duration and type of~     exercise. Therefore, the aims of the study are: 1) to assess the changes in selected~     parameters of blood pressure, cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition and biological~     markers brought about by a period of 16-week of different aerobic exercise programs with~     hypocaloric diet for overweight or obesity and primary hypertensive adults, and 2) to examine~     the effect of six months detraining subsequent to intervention.

NCT02039492,Sympathetic Renal Denervation Versus Increment of Pharmacological Treatment in Resistant Arterial Hypertension.,"Background: In hypertension, a highly prevalent disease, up to 10-15% of hypertensive      patients have uncontrolled blood pressure despite a regimen of ≥ 3 drugs, which is known as      resistant hypertension (RH). Cardiovascular prognosis in patients with RH is worse than in      controlled hypertensives. Efferent renal sympathetic nerves play an important role in volume      homeostasis and blood pressure. A novel minimally invasive technique based on the use of      selective radiofrequency renal sympathetic denervation has shown promising preliminary      results for the treatment of these patients. On the other hand, some patients with RH could      improve their blood pressure control by adding spironolactone, an antagonist of aldosterone      receptors.      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency renal sympathetic denervation in      patients with RH, as compared with the addition of spironolactone to the therapeutic regimen      at baseline.      Method: interventional, prospective, randomized, open study, of a cohort of 50 patients with      RH, with office systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg and also with 24h systolic blood pressure      ≥ 140 mmHg, despite treatment with ≥ 3 drugs in adequate doses, one of them a diuretic, and      whitout treatment with either spironolactone or eplerenone.

NCT00408512,Pharmacosurveillance and Pharmacogenetics of First-line Diuretics in Hypertension: The StayOnDiur Study,"Background: The use of thiazide diuretics in the treatment of hypertension (HT) is widely      considered a first line treatment, given the efficacy and low cost of this class of drugs.      This indication is not unanimous, because thiazides can cause metabolic alterations and other      side effects increasing cardiac and cerebrovascular risk, which reduce compliance to      treatment and increase health care system cost. However, large intervention trials in HT      suggest that the improvement in cardiovascular prognosis of HT patients depends more on      follow-up procedures than on type of drug used. Furthermore, the investigators have      documented improved compliance to antihypertensive therapy by implementing cooperation      between general practitioners (GPs) and HT specialists.      Objectives: In a multicenter, open label randomized study the investigators will compare the      persistence on therapy of thiazides versus other treatments, as a first line antihypertensive      therapy, in a clinical setting characterized by a strict cooperation between GPs and HT      specialist. The investigators will also analyse candidate genes with impact on drug-induced      metabolic alterations to elucidate the pathophysiology of these phenomena.      Methods: 260 GPs will recruit 2600 hypertensive patients with indication to pharmacological      treatment and randomise them to starting treatment with chlortalidone (12.5 to 25 mg daily,      1300 pts) or a GP decided single drug (excluding thiazides) or combination therapy at highest      tolerated dose. In both groups any other class of antihypertensive drugs can be added over      time in order to achieve blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg). Follow-up will last 2 years.      Blood sample and urine analyses, carotid and cardiac ultrasound will be performed at baseline      and scheduled time points. Genotyping will be performed by sequencing. Data will be collected      and stored using a web based centralized Case Report Form (CRF) Expected results: Results      will highlight whether a follow-up strategy based on tight cooperation between GPs and HT      specialists can allow the use of thiazides as first line antihypertensive therapy without any      negative effect on persistence, adherence and efficacy of the treatment. These data can be      used to reduce total burden of the Health Care System in HT by replacing more expensive drugs      with diuretics in the 50% of hypertensive patients, who do not receive this class of drugs.      Furthermore, the pharmacogenetic approach may clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms of      drug-induced metabolic side effects",C0020538;C0012798;C0947630,C0585941;C0585941;C0003364;C0009429;C0012802;C0595938;C1655737;C0003364;C1516308;C0277785;C3887460;C0005823;C0008294;C0020538;C0184661;C0857121;C0857121;C0877248;C0086388;C0546816;C0546816;C0086388;C1301725;C0087111;C1285573;C0087111;C0087111;C0541746;C0087111;C0033325;C0541746;C0087111;C0087111;C0541746;C0541746;C0087111;C0012798;C0184511;C1517001;C0679199;C0205160;C0018787;C0087111;C0087111;C0542559;C0025663;C0741968;C0087136;C1552839;C1518681;C3244317;C0456387;C0013227;C1705425;C0947630;C0456387;C0005767;C0042036;C0013227;C0456387;C0013227;C0013227;C1273517;C0013227;C0013227;C3245479;C1273517;C0013227;C1550472;C0010132;C0184661;C0018017;C0086960;C4699613;C0725813;C2825142;C0441621;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C3714738;C3714738;C1294197;C3844714;C2707259;C2707259;C2707259;C0776963;C1522411;C1254223;C2347500;C2735115;C3272565;C0728774;C4534364;C0277785;C1854293;C1854293;C4698129,0.0,0.0,0,10.0,5.0,0.003105253822557614,0.0034059098443592092,0,0

NCT00921570,"The Effects of Renin Angiotensin System Blockage (RAS), Calcium Channel Blocker and Combined Drugs on TWEAK, PTX3 and FMD Levels in Diabetic Proteinuric Patients With Hypertension","Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most important complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and      the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Diabetic nephropathy is a clinical      syndrome characterized by persistent albuminuria (> 300 mg/d or > 200 mcg/min) that is      confirmed on at least 2 occasions 3 to 6 months apart, a relentless decline in the glomerular      filtration rate (GFR), and elevated arterial blood pressure. In addition to the renal      hemodynamic alterations, patients with overt diabetic nephropathy (dipstick-positive      proteinuria and decreasing GFR) generally develop systemic hypertension. Hypertension is an      adverse factor in all progressive renal diseases and seems especially so in diabetic      nephropathy. The deleterious effects of hypertension are likely directed at the vasculature      and microvasculature. Use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), strict glycemic control and use of antilipidemic drugs      may improve progression of DN.      TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK, TNFSF12) is a member of the TNF superfamily of      structurally related cytokines. The human TWEAK gene encodes a 249-amino acid type II      transmembrane glycoprotein (30 kD). TWEAK may be expressed as a full-length, membrane-bound      protein and as a 156-amino acid, 18-kD soluble protein, (sTWEAK) that results from      proteolysis of TWEAK. TWEAK gene is expressed in many tissues, including brain, kidney,      heart, arterial wall, monocytes and macrophages. Reduced soluble TNF-like weak inducer of      apoptosis (sTWEAK) plasma levels have been reported both in patients with subclinical      atherosclerosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD).      Long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a multimeric inflammatory mediator. Increased serum PTX3 levels      have been reported among end-stage renal disease patients. Moreover, PTX3 has been suggested      to represent a novel mortality risk factor, and elevated PTX3 levels have been shown to      accompany increased albuminuria among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).      There is no data about the effects of Renin angiotensin system blockage (RAS), calcium      channel blocker and combined drugs on TWEAK and PTX3 levels in diabetic proteinuric patients      with hypertension. The aim of this study was to find out whether the beneficial effects of      RAS blockage, calcium channel blocker and combined drugs in diabetic hypertensive proteinuric      patients has any relation with the alteration of TWEAK and PTX3 levels. The investigators      searched for the effects of angiotensin II (AII) receptor blocker (Valsartan 160 mg), calcium      channel blocker (Amlodipine 10 mg) and AII receptor blocker plus calcium channel blocker      (Valsartan 160 mg + Amlodipine 10 mg) on the clinical and laboratory parameters of diabetic      hypertensive proteinuric patients.",C0006684;C0020538;C0003018;C1706968;C0241863;C0373719;C0013227;C0814183;C1550655;C0033687;C2946261,C0022661;C1272641;C0022661;C0006684;C0006684;C0020538;C0011881;C0011881;C0011881;C0011849;C0004153;C0870261;C0870261;C0022658;C0022658;C0022658;C0003009;C0009566;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0857121;C0857121;C0001925;C4281788;C0033687;C0022658;C0003018;C0003018;C0242656;C0035648;C0001925;C0003018;C0442797;C0051696;C0750484;C0216784;C0216784;C0039082;C0441090;C1446409;C0241863;C0700287;C0127400;C0700287;C0241863;C0241863;C0241863;C0006675;C0006675;C3245511;C0332148;C0022646;C0032105;C0022646;C0013227;C0814183;C0814183;C0814183;C0814183;C0814183;C0006104;C0018787;C0229671;C0679622;C0373719;C0013227;C0814183;C0947630;C0013227;C0814183;C0022661;C3714552;C0870814;C3714552;C3245479;C0017654;C0017654;C2350571;C0017654;C1979715;C0507850;C0233492;C0184511;C0072522;C1294065;C0033687;C0033687;C0033687;C1518681;C0233492;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C1979715;C1979715;C0022885;C0442743;C3839460;C0076106;C4084912;C1524094;C0200637;C0856882;C0856882;C1561542;C0814183;C0814183;C1328018;C0150312;C3272565;C4522152;C0244399;C1706968;C1706968;C3272565;C2363670;C0033621;C0033621;C1854293;C0210233;C0546816;C1295665;C0151576,0.0,0.0,0,17.0,17.0,0.0026208622710856546,0.003193024581648016,0,0

We hypothesized that cocoa consumption lowers      blood pressure by augmentation of the circulating vasodilative nitric oxide (NO) pool due to      the action of the cocoa polyphenols at the vascular endothelium.      To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a randomized single-blind, parallel group study in      subjects with mild essential hypertension to evaluate the effects of polyphenol-rich dark      chocolate versus polyphenol-free white chocolate on blood pressure and plasma levels of cocoa      phenols, circulating bioactive nitric oxide, and plasma markers of oxidative stress. After a      7 day cocoa-free run-in period, 44 subjects will be 1:1 randomized to receive over 18 weeks      daily doses of either dark chocolate (6.3 g per day with a total of 30 mg of polyphenols and      30 kcal) or polyphenol free white chocolate (5.6 g per day with 30 kcal, containing similar      amounts of macronutrients, electrolytes and vitamins). Subjects will be counseled to maintain      an isocaloric diet and to abstain from other cocoa products during the study. Blood pressure      and plasma parameters will be assessed in each subject after the run-in period and after 6,      12, and 18 weeks of treatment.",C0005823;C0020538;C1138626;C1547225,C0085580;C1096775;C3887460;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C1293122;C0028128;C0028128;C0013832;C0071649;C0071649;C0071649;C0071649;C0071649;C0939909;C0939909;C0939909;C0939909;C0087111;C0031843;C0005847;C0042890;C0947630;C0031428;C0087136;C0032105;C0032105;C0038435;C0025344;C0032105;C0025344;C0939909;C0939909;C0939909;C0939909;C0939909;C0456909;C0947630;C0939909;C0939909;C0939909;C0947630;C0392366;C1561538;C0600140;C1561538;C1561538;C0600140;C1820370;C1964257;C0184511;C1947907;C1518681;C0005516;C3540799;C4067746;C1552839;C3272565;C4554418;C0220825,0.0,0.0,0,70.0,70.0,0.002803533807847237,0.003141189168620209,0,0
NCT01996085,Non-invasive Haemodynamic Assessment in Hypertension,"Arterial hypertension (AH) is an important clinical social and economic problem. In the      pathogenesis of AH increased BP is a result of complex mechanisms i. e. fluid retention,      increased vascular resistance and hyperkinetic heart function. Impedance cardiography (ICG)      is a simple and safe, non-invasive method of hemodynamic monitoring which allows simultaneous      assessment of i. e. BP, cardiac index, heart rate, the fluid content in the chest and      systemic vascular resistance.      The detailed effect of treatment based on ICG has not been evaluated so far in the long-term      observation and for other clinically relevant parameters, such as central blood pressure,      left ventricular hypertrophy, metabolic disturbances, parameters of antioxidative-oxidative      balance and endothelial function. Therefore, the following main objectives of the study were      defined:        -  Evaluation of usefulness of impedance cardiography in optimizing treatment of patients           with hypertension in the area of reduction and control of blood pressure, hemodynamic           parameters, biochemical markers and quality of life.        -  Evaluation of complex pathophysiological mechanisms associated with hypertension           including hemodynamic, anthropometric, psychological and biochemical parameters as well           as the effect of antihypertensive treatment on these phenomena.      The study will be randomized (1:1), prospective and controlled in parallel with conventional      treatment. The subjects will be divided into groups according to the pre-established random      order:        1. empiric group (GE), in which treatment choice will be based on clinical data and current           guidelines        2. hemodynamic group (HD), in which treatment choice will be based on clinical data and           current guidelines considering hemodynamic parameters established with ICG method.      All patients will undergo a detailed examination three times: before treatment, then after 3      and 12 months of treatment.      The authors expect that the study will consolidate the importance of ICG in the diagnosis of      patients with AH. Simultaneous multiparametric evaluation of the subjects guarantees a unique      and innovative results which can enhance our knowledge in pathophysiology of AH and      reversibility of adverse mechanisms associated with this disease.",C0020538;C0031809;C4281788;C1455871,C1258192;C0149721;C1753303;C4082936;C0007185;C0020538;C0042380;C0337629;C0003364;C0268000;C0518214;C0277785;C0005823;C0428776;C1306597;C1516606;C1516606;C0699748;C0221533;C0020538;C0020538;C0700325;C4281788;C4281788;C4281788;C4281788;C0031809;C0031809;C0018810;C0018017;C0220825;C0220825;C0162791;C0162791;C0220825;C0162537;C0087111;C0087111;C4551656;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0011900;C0376554;C0031843;C0031843;C0014653;C0012634;C0025663;C1518681;C1518681;C1552839;C0025663;C0018787;C0817096;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0746556;C4699604;C1552853;C4684637;C0005516;C0723323;C2911690;C2075796;C4084912;C0220825;C1522411;C1552839;C1552839;C1334278;C4554418;C0939261;C0939261;C0277785;C0151576;C0151576,0.0,0.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0022089628190679954,0.0031161981116787155,0,0

NCT02023450,Testing of HIV Protease Inhibitors to Suppress Inflammation and Improve Cardio Pulmonary Hemodynamics in Subjects With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,"Study Rationale:There is recent evidence that HIV protease inhibitors (HIV-PI) can improve      pulmonary hemodynamics in experimental models of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). There      is also experimental evidence that both TLR4 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)      participate in the pathogenesis of experimental pulmonary hypertension. A recent high      throughput screen for inhibitors of HMGB1 induced macrophage activation yielded HIV-protease      inhibitors (PIs) as potent inhibitors of HMGB1 induced cytokine production. Based on the      experimental evidence we propose a trial to determine whether HIV-PIs will alter the      pathobiology of PAH.      Study Objectives:The main objective of this study is to determine whether saquinavir and      ritonavir (SQV+RIT) which have a well-characterized safety profile in humans will reduce bio      markers of inflammation and pulmonary artery pressures in patients with PAH.      Study Hypothesis:We hypothesize that the HIV-PI, SQV+RIT, will reduce circulating parameters      of inflammation including HMGB1, IL1-beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha and CRP. Our end      points will be changes in these parameters from baseline over the duration of the study.We      hypothesize that treatment with SQV+RIT will reduce pulmonary artery(PA) pressure of patients      with PAH as measured by echocardiography.      Study Design:This is a single center open label phase 0 study to evaluate the effect of SQV      +RIT in patients with IPAH. Subjects with IPAH(N=20) will be enrolled into a study, which      will be divided into 3 cohorts and entail the administration of HIV protease inhibitors in      three doses. The first cohort (n=3) will receive a starting dose of SQV 0.3 mg/kg twice daily      in combination with RIT 0.03 mg/kg twice daily. If the first dose is well-tolerated, the      second cohort (n= 3 ) with IPAH will be given doses of SQV 3 mg/kg and RIT 0.3 mg/kg twice      daily. If the second dose is well-tolerated, the last cohort (n= 14 ) with IPAH will be given      doses of SQV 15 mg/kg and RIT 1.5 mg/kg twice daily.",C0162714;C0021368;C0020538;C2707265;C2707265;C0003842;C0184511;C4281788;C2954564,C0428642;C0162714;C0162714;C0020542;C0020538;C0920262;C0086272;C1327413;C4684758;C0013516;C1533734;C4281788;C0699748;C0021368;C0021368;C2983265;C0286738;C0024109;C0024109;C0018017;C0292818;C0087111;C0024109;C0425245;C0030946;C0460139;C4684790;C0199230;C0087136;C1518681;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0439095;C0947630;C1705425;C0947630;C0947630;C3244317;C3244317;C3539181;C0018017;C0184511;C0005516;C0332534;C1328018;C1328018;C1552839;C0018792;C0441229;C0728774;C0220825;C2945733;C4082977;C4082977,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0025571801793251503,0.003020929462274992,0,0

NCT00971165,Diuretics and Angiotensin-Receptor Blocker Agents in Patients With Stage I Hypertension,"High blood pressure is the major risk factor for Cardiovascular disease (CVD). The prevalence      of hypertension in Brazil was established in population-based studies conducted in different      cities and States, varying from 22.3 to 44% of adults.      The benefit of drug treatment of hypertension to prevent major cardiovascular events was      consistently demonstrated in a large series of clinical trials controlled by placebo.      Diuretics are at least as efficacious as other blood pressure-lowering drugs, are well      tolerated, have longer duration of action and the advantage of very low cost to be used in a      population intervention. Chlorthalidone is the more efficacious agent. Its main limitation is      to induce hypokalemia in a proportion of patients, an adverse effect that can be antagonized      by a potassium-sparing diuretic, as amiloride.      A study comparing diuretic with an ARB agent is therefore recommendable in Brazil, in order      to support the decisions of the Health Secretary in regard to blood pressure agents supply      for the Brazilian population.

Background: Cupping is an ancient treatment remedy that has been used for many centuries in      many parts of the world. In the Middle East, Wet cupping ""Hijama"" is still a popular      treatment because of its religious background. Despite of that, it still has little      scientific evidence that proves its efficacy. Many hijama healers claim that they have      observed dramatic improvement in Blood pressure control of hypertension patients. Not many      studies support that. This study should help to prove or disprove this hypothesis.      Objectives:        -  To determine the efficacy of wet cupping on blood pressure among high blood pressure           patients.        -  To assess the incidence of wet cupping side effects in the intervention group.      Methods: The study design is a randomised controlled trial.

NCT00904007,Interactive Spaced Education to Optimize Hypertension Management,"Online interactive spaced education (ISE) is a novel educational methodology based on the      ""spacing effect"", the psychological finding that repeated presentations of educational      material over spaced intervals increase learning efficiency and improve knowledge retention.      ISE is delivered using periodic emails that contain clinical case scenarios and      multiple-choice question. The investigators recently completed a randomized trial involving      95 VISN 1 primary care providers (PCPs) which demonstrated that an ISE intervention can      significantly improve clinician's practice patterns. Those clinicians randomized to the ISE      intervention on prostate cancer screening demonstrated a 26% relative reduction in      inappropriate screening. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial      involving PCPs in VISN 1 to determine whether ISE can (1) increase knowledge of the      appropriate treatment of hypertensive patients, (2) reduce clinical inertia in hypertension      management, and (3) improve the blood pressure control in hypertensive patients.      Anticipated Impacts on Veterans' Healthcare: This study aims to demonstrate that online      interactive spaced education (ISE) can improve providers' care of patients with hypertension.

NCT02182830,24 Week Efficacy and Safety Study of Empagliflozin (BI 10773) in Hypertensive Black/African American Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension,"This trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin compared with      placebo in hypertensive black/African Americans with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Since      hyperglycaemia and hypertension are key risk factors for both micro- and macrovascular      complications, assessment of both glucose and BP lowering effects of empagliflozin in      hypertensive African American patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus could provide clinically      highly relevant, new information for the use of empagliflozin.      Essential hypertension is four times more common in African Americans than in Caucasians.      One of the risk factors for hypertension is sodium sensitivity and approximately one third of      the essential hypertensive population is responsive to sodium intake. There is a higher      association of hypertension with sodium sensitivity in African American patients with type 2      Diabetes Mellitus.      The treatment duration of this trial (24 weeks) will enable assessment of the clinically      relevant endpoint of a decrease in HbA1c, a well accepted measurement of chronic glycaemic      control and the key secondary endpoints of decreases in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP      (DBP) at 12 and 24 weeks.",C0011860;C3490348;C0020538;C0947630;C1550655;C0857121,C0085580;C0011849;C0011849;C0011849;C3242228;C0020456;C3490348;C0009566;C3490348;C3490348;C0489645;C0857121;C0020538;C0035648;C0857121;C0035648;C0020538;C0857121;C0020538;C0004083;C0031809;C0031809;C0087111;C0027627;C0032042;C0017725;C3245511;C0562342;C1306620;C1305849;C1820370;C0442797;C0442709;C1555587;C0237677;C0237677;C0237284;C1518681;C0721716;C0202165;C0442797;C0332534;C0018792;C1328018;C0018792;C1995642,56.0,2086.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.002701092953618517,0.0027940051734247928,0,0

NCT03111836,Effectiveness of User and Expert Driven Internet-based Lifestyle Interventions on Hypertension Control,"Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Lifestyle      counseling is recommended as a first line therapy for reducing blood pressure (BP) and risk      for cardiovascular events. Recent studies suggest that e-based lifestyle interventions are      effective in evoking therapeutic change in BP1. However, BP response and adherence to      exercise and diet behavior varies significantly after e-based interventions due to variations      in treatment methodologies. Consensus is not yet established for a standardized e-counseling      protocol for hypertension. As noted in our systematic review, the two dominant models of      e-counseling procedures are expert-driven (protocol driven, prescriptive) and user-driven      (self-guided, collaborative). Expert-driven programs prescribe specific changes for lifestyle      behavior which are intended to facilitate compliance to behavioral change. In contrast, the      user-driven method actively involves the subject in goal-setting and/or the selection of the      intervention used to reach the behavioral goal. One conclusion from the systematic review is      that these models are used indiscriminately in e-counseling programs. There is currently      inadequate data to determine the efficacy of programs that are expert-driven vs. user-driven      in reducing BP while modifying lifestyle behaviour. It is possible that a combination of      expert-driven and user-driven features for lifestyle e-counseling is most effective. However,      before these two approaches can be combined, it is essential to establish the strengths and      limitations of each model.",C4553491;C1273869;C0020538;C0013126;C1564718,C0007222;C1320716;C1955832;C1955832;C0005823;C0886296;C0886296;C0020538;C0020538;C0184661;C0035648;C0010210;C0010210;C0010210;C0010210;C0010210;C0087111;C1704632;C0442711;C0442711;C1552740;C1551357;C0332149;C0087111;C0947630;C0542559;C0025663;C3161035;C1551994;C0018017;C1273517;C0018017;C1273517;C3245479;C0087111;C3539181;C0184661;C0278329;C0677505;C0452240;C0677505;C0677505;C0233514;C0029939;C3714738;C2986890;C0301572;C0449900;C3161035;C0013126;C0013126;C0013126;C0013126;C0013126;C3161035;C0013126;C0013126;C0013126;C0013126;C1328018;C0678257;C0042070;C0042070;C0042070;C4698129;C4082977,0.0,0.0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0021176151189181355,0.0027383371477111363,0,0

NCT01686282,Blueberry Consumption Improves Vascular Function and Lowers Blood Pressure in Postmenopausal Women With Pre- and Stage 1-hypertension,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S. Americans      have been more concerned about their blood cholesterol levels and dietary cholesterol intakes      rather than their overall cardiovascular health risk factors leading to CVD such as      hypertension, vascular dysfunction, inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables and      physical activity. Statistics show that approximately 91% of individuals with CVD have      vascular dysfunction which is attributed to endothelial and autonomic dysfunction leading to      increased arterial stiffness.      The investigators long-term goal is to provide feasible and effective dietary ways for pre-      and stage 1- hypertensive individuals to normalize their blood pressure (BP), improve      vascular function and thereby reducing their cardiovascular risk and enhancing the quality of      life. Blueberries are a rich source of phenolic compounds and these compounds may play an      important role in promoting cardiovascular health. Considering the strong possibility that      phytochemicals present in blueberry work additively or synergistically, it would be ideal to      investigate the cardioprotective effects of blueberry as a whole. The investigators overall      objective to bring forth evidence that blueberry consumption will reduce BP and      cardiovascular risk factors including endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and      autonomic dysfunction in pre- and stage 1-hypertensive postmenopausal women. The      investigators hypothesize that blueberry supplementation will improve vascular function and      will lower blood pressure in postmenopausal women with pre-hypertension.

A total of 100 adults with uncontrolled high blood      pressure will be followed for 3 months. The intervention includes 1) algorithm-driven      antihypertensive treatment for all patients using fixed-dose combination and lipid lowering      for high risk patients, 2) motivational conversation for high risk patients; and 3) telephone      based follow-ups of all patients by a team of physician supervised nurse practitioners and      nurses. The change in BP will be compared between intervention and control groups. The      structured care including the above mentioned components is likely to be more effective than      usual care in lowering BP levels of patients with uncontrolled high blood pressure. Such a      program is also likely to be more cost effective in terms of money spent for improving      quality of patients' life. The findings of the pilot will inform the design of a larger      cluster randomized trial in eight polyclinics in Singapore.

NCT00374829,Impact of an IT-Based and Healthcare Professional Support Program on Patients With High Blood Pressure,"The study is a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a program using      information technology (IT) and healthcare professional support in patients with high blood      pressure (BP) compared to usual care. The program helps patients monitor their own BP and      medication and keeps nurses,physicians and pharmacists informed while respecting patient      confidentiality. The IT system links directly with the patient's pharmacy data. Using      pharmacy data and responses to questions on compliance and BP control, the IT system provides      appropriate counselling, telephone reminders, generates prescription refill and renewal      reminder calls and monitors BP. The system reports compliance and self recorded BP      measurements to healthcare providers and also links with a nurse. This is so that the nurse,      the patient's doctor and pharmacist can help answer questions about medication and      controlling high blood pressure.      A total of 500 patients in Laval, Quebec will participate in the study. Half of the patients      will have the program plus usual care and the other have usual care only. We hypothesize that      the program will improve BP control by helping patients take their medication properly and by      helping doctors ensure that the best strength and kinds of medication are used to control      high blood pressure.

NCT01847716,Transforming Growth Factor Beta Signalling in the Development of Muscle Weakness in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease that causes raised blood pressure in blood      vessels that pick up oxygen from the lungs. It has a life expectancy similar to some cancers.      There is treatment available but there is no cure. We now know that PAH is associated with      weakness in the muscles in the legs, which contributes to the symptoms patients' experience.      Researchers believe that certain proteins found in high levels in the blood of patients with      other chronic diseases can affect muscle function and growth. One of these proteins is called      growth differentiating factor (GDF) 8, high levels of which are associated with muscle      weakness in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) and heart failure (HF). Interestingly      there are drugs available which block the actions of GDF-8 on muscle cells which has been      shown in animals to result in increased muscle size. A related protein called GDF-15 is found      in elevated levels in patients PAH, and is linked to prognosis. Our preliminary data suggests      that GDF-15 can also directly influence muscle size in a number of situations. We aim to      investigate the role of GDF-15 and related molecules in the development of muscle weakness in      patients with PAH. We will do this by measuring certain markers of muscle weakness and taking      blood and muscle samples in patients and controls. We will then compare the levels of GDF-15      in these tissues in those with and without muscle wasting. We hope this work will lead to a      greater understanding of the role of GDF-15 in the development of muscle weakness in patients      with PAH. GDF-15 levels may be important in allowing us to define which patients have muscle      weakness. In the future we aim to perform a clinical trial of drugs which block the actions      of GDF-15.",C0151786;C1510411;C0020538;C0678723;C2707265;C0003842;C0018270,C2973725;C0008679;C0517929;C0030552;C0030552;C0030552;C0005823;C0026846;C1096775;C0018801;C0162340;C0243107;C0243107;C0237607;C0087111;C0024109;C0033325;C3714552;C3714552;C3714552;C0012634;C0005847;C0006826;C3540698;C0030054;C0001721;C0018270;C0018270;C4684637;C0005767;C0024109;C0005767;C0013227;C0028778;C0005767;C0013227;C0028778;C1140621;C3245479;C1704326;C0392347;C1442948;C1704326;C0581668;C1457887;C0233492;C0233492;C0005516;C0333166;C1716046;C3869883;C4084912;C0856882;C0011167;C1328018;C0026826;C1511938;C0087130;C0040597;C0033621;C0087130;C0040597,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.002491772099629637,0.0025808031229498296,0,0

NCT02099578,The Effects of Strawberries on Blood Pressure in Postmenopausal Women,"~     Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US. Statistics show that~     approximately 91% of individuals with CVD have vascular dysfunction. Hypertension is a major~     modifiable risk factor for CVD and approximately 60% of adults in the US are pre-hypertensive~     and hypertensive. In addition, the prevalence of hypertension is associated with aging in~     both genders; however, the increase in blood pressure (BP) in women after menopause exceeds~     that of men.~      The development of effective and safe strategies to improve vascular function is of~     significance as it can have a great impact on quality of life, productivity and economic~     burden for the affected populations. One such alternative would be to introduce into the diet~     food sources that are rich in naturally occurring bioactive compounds. Thus, the long-term~     goal of the investigators is to provide feasible and effective dietary ways for~     postmenopausal women to improve their vascular function and quality of life.~      Strawberries are a rich source of bioactive compounds and its total antioxidant content ranks~     third among all fruits and vegetables. Hence, the purpose of this study is to bring forth~     evidence that incorporation of strawberries into the diet will reduce blood pressure and~     improve cardiovascular function in pre- and stage 1-hypertensive postmenopausal women.~      Sixty eligible postmenopausal women between the ages of 45 and 65 and a seated BP of ≥ 130/85~     mm Hg but ≤ 160/100 mmHg at the screening visit will be randomly assigned to one of three~     groups:~        1. 25 g freeze-dried strawberry powder;~        2. 50 g freeze-dried strawberry powder; or~        3. placebo powder. Participants will be asked to consume the supplements for 8-weeks.~          Medical history, medication use, dietary intake, and physical activity will be assessed~          at 0-, 4-, and 8-weeks followed by blood draw. Serum levels of markers of cardiovascular~          function as well as oxidative stress and inflammation will be measured.~      The investigators hypothesize that regular consumption of strawberry will improve~     cardiovascular function, decrease BP and blood markers of oxidative stress as well as~     inflammation. Investigators also expect the findings of this study to provide a foundation~     for further studies to examine the effects of long-term incorporation of strawberry into the~     diet and the integrity of cardiovascular system.~   ",C0005823,C0497247;C0262926;C3887460;C0007465;C0005823;C3887460;C3887460;C3887460;C0020538;C0020538;C0021368;C0021368;C1710032;C0012634;C0449416;C0038435;C0038435;C0001811;C0005767;C0229671;C0005767;C3887460;C0035648;C0003402;C4284232;C0243095;C0184511;C0184511;C0184511;C0032042;C0332128;C0449416;C2946261;C4255207;C0184511;C0206158,0.0,0.0,-1,3.0,3.0,0.0014663774346086766,0.0025159591040465872,0,0
NCT00327574,Population Based Strategies for Effective Control of High Blood Pressure in Pakistan,"Studies have established that high blood pressure (BP) is the most common risk factor for      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite a heavy burden of hypertension (33% of all persons aged      45 years and over), there are no reliable data on comparative strategies to manage      hypertension in Pakistan. Our Wellcome Trust funded pilot study in Karachi, Pakistan on 320      adults aged 40 years and over showed that the prevalence of hypertension (95% CI) was 40.3%      (34.9-45.7%), and CVD was 32.5% (27.6-37.8%).      We will now conduct a study with two components: 1) cross sectional study to determine the      prevalence of CVD, and its determinants in Karachi, Pakistan; and 2) prospective, 2x2      factorial design, cluster allocation intervention study to evaluate the impact of a i)      Population approach of household health education (HHE) by community health workers (CHW) on      BP levels of population aged 5 years or over in low-middle income communities of Karachi; and      ii) High-Risk approach of special BP management administered by intensively trained local      general practitioners on BP levels of hypertensive subjects aged > = 40 years from the above      population.      The cost effective BP control strategy would serve as a model for a much-needed national      level hypertension control programme in Pakistan, and possibly other developing countries in      South Asia.      We hypothesize that 1) HHE delivered by trained CHW is superior to no HHE in lowering BP      levels of the population; and 2) management of hypertension by specially trained GPs is      better than usual care provided in the communities of Karachi in lowering blood pressure of      hypertensive subjects.",C0020538;C0679199;C1564718,C0007222;C0020538;C1096775;C0005823;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0857121;C0020538;C0020538;C0857121;C0035648;C0679199;C0376636;C0376636;C0424927;C3858758;C0679199;C3245511;C1552826;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C3161035;C3245479;C4321237;C1550472;C3843172;C4699619;C4699619;C1820370;C1820370;C2735418;C0080194;C0080194;C0080194;C0086034;C1555588;C2735115;C1552858;C0308779;C0220825;C3854058;C0332149;C3842265;C0701928;C4082977,0.0,0.0,0,103.0,20.6,0.002685881269269545,0.0025154334054338953,0,0

NCT01637909,Korean Life-Style Modification Effects on Blood Pressure,"~     In hypertension, lifestyle modification has been proven to be effective in reducing blood~     pressure while decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The dietary approaches to stop~     hypertension(DASH) diet, sodium restriction and exercise has been shown to reduce systolic~     blood pressure by 8-14mmHg, 2-8mmHg and 4-9mmHg, respectively. The DASH-sodium diet has been~     shown to have additional systolic blood pressure lowering effect of 7.2mmHg, which is equal~     to adding one antihypertensive drug. However, as the dietary pattern is different in the~     Korean population, the investigators cannot implement the data from Western countries~     directly to the Korean population. For example, the consumption of dairy products is much~     smaller in the Korean population when compared to the western population. Therefore, the~     effectiveness of DASH-sodium diet and exercise on blood pressure lowering in the Korean~     population is not well defined. In this study, the investigators sought to determine the~     effectiveness of the DASH-salt diet and DASH-salt diet plus exercise on brachial blood~     pressure lowering. The study will be performed on untreated prehypertension patients and~     uncontrolled hypertensive patients undergoing anti hypertensive treatment with blood pressure~     measured between 140-159mmHg/90-99mmHg at the time of enrollment.~   ",C0005823;C3840684,C3887460;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0020538;C3840684;C0442797;C0012634;C0337443;C0337443;C0337443;C0005767;C1516879;C0020538;C0005767;C0005767;C2947996;C0376495,0.0,0.0,-1,5.0,5.0,0.0010237698681002736,0.002494221640656712,0,0

Techniques that reduce the respiratory rate are shown as a~     effective non-pharmacological treatment in controlling blood pressure. Evidence has shown~     that a slow and deep breathing rate, around 10 breaths per minute or less, significantly~     reduces blood pressure. However, the physiological mechanisms involved in blood pressure~     decrease due to decreased respiratory rate are not yet known.

NCT01037920,An Intervention to Improve Communication Between Physicians and Minority Patients With Hypertension,"The objective of the project is a test-of-concept of an intervention to reduce the effects of      the perception of discrimination on the care of patients with chronic illness. Perception of      discrimination manifests itself as stereotype threat. We hypothesize that stereotype threat      impairs communication between minority patients and their physicians because of increased      stress and diminished trust, resulting in interactions that are less successful at enhancing      patient self-efficacy, in turn resulting in lower rates of adherence with anti-hypertensive      medication.      The intervention is a self-affirmation exercise performed prior to a patient-physician visit.      A similar intervention has been shown to reduce the racial gap in academic performance in      middle school classrooms.      We will explore the mechanistic effects of the intervention by analysis of audiotapes of      patient-provider visits following the intervention. We will measure the effect of the      intervention on minority hypertensive patients' adherence with antihypertensive medication      and blood pressure.      We will enroll 200 African American and Latino patients with hypertension and randomize 100      patients to perform the exercise and 100 patients to perform a null control exercise before      the visit. We will assess change in patient's adherence with antihypertensive medications and      in blood pressure over the six months following the index visit. In order to better      understand the effects of the intervention we will measure subject's mood following the      exercise, and self-reported stress levels, trust in the physician, and medication      self-efficacy following the visit. We will also assess the quality of the patient-provider      interaction from detailed analysis of audiotapes and from patient questionnaires.

NCT00709137,Spironolactone Versus Amiloride as an Add on Agent in Resistant Hypertension,"~     Joint National Committee 7 (JNC-7) defines resistant hypertension as a persistent elevation~     of blood pressure (BP) above goal - ≥ 140/90 mm Hg for the general hypertensive population or~     ≥ 130/80 mm Hg for persons with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease - for at least~     three months despite treatment with three or more optimally dosed antihypertensive agents,~     including a diuretic. The exact prevalence of resistant hypertension is uncertain but may~     include 5-20% of hypertensive persons in primary care settings and 15-35% of the older,~     higher cardiovascular risk hypertensive patients incorporated into recent clinical trials of~     antihypertensive therapy. Observational studies demonstrate that patients with resistant~     hypertension experience a higher rate of cardiovascular and renal target organ damage such as~     left ventricular hypertrophy, microalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency and more~     cardiovascular disease (CVD) events than patients whose hypertension is well-controlled.~     Additionally, resistant hypertension patients may be subjected to the considerable expense of~     multiple office visits, diagnostic testing for secondary causes of hypertension, and referral~     to hypertension specialists. Because multiple factors can contribute to resistant~     hypertension, an explicit, sequential approach to evaluation and management is essential to~     optimize blood pressure, reduce cardiorenal morbidity and mortality, and avoid unnecessary~     expense. A number of observational studies have suggested the potential efficacy of both~     spironolactone and amiloride when added to a 3 drug antihypertensive regimen, but to date no~     randomized study has directly compared the two agents.

The effectiveness of non-drug interventions to prevent      hypertension is low in the long term. It may be hypothesized that a population-based drug      intervention could reduce relevantly the burden of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.      Diuretics are at least as efficacious as other blood pressure-lowering drugs, are well      tolerated, have longer duration of action and the advantage of very low cost to be used in a      population intervention. Chlorthalidone is the more efficacious agent. Its main limitation is      to induce hypokalemia in a proportion of patients, an adverse effect that can be antagonized      by a potassium-sparing diuretic, as amiloride.

NCT00627861,Combined Renin Inhibition/Beta-blockade,"~     Antihypertensive drug treatment is effective in only about 50% of patients. One mechanism~     responsible for treatment failure is a drug related stimulation of the~     renin-angiotension-aldosterone-system (RAAS). Several classes of medications that treat~     hypertension by blocking the RAAS system have been developed. However, the kidney responds to~     these drug treatments by producing greater amounts of renin. This high level of renin can~     reduce the effectiveness of some of these medications, ultimately causing the blood pressure~     to rise. This is one reason why blood pressure can be difficult to control in a certain~     percentage of patients.~      The hypothesis to be tested in the proposed study is that beta-adrenergic blockade~     (β-blockade), when superimposed upon aliskiren, a drug that competitively inhibits plasma~     renin activity (PRA) but stimulates the release of renin by the kidneys (plasma renin~     concentration [PRC]), can suppress the reactive increase in PRC that occurs during aliskiren~     monotherapy.~      The primary aim of this study is to measure plasma renin concentration (PRC) and plasma renin~     activity (PRA) levels during renin inhibition with aliskiren and combined renin~     inhibition/β-blocker treatment to determine whether the addition of a β-blocker attenuates~     the rise in plasma renin concentration (PRC). A secondary aim is to determine whether~     combined treatment further suppresses PRA and blood pressure.~   ",C0021467;C3540676,C0162643;C0005823;C0020538;C0002006;C4284232;C4284232;C0021467;C0021467;C3540676;C0022646;C0032105;C0032105;C0032105;C0032105;C2946261;C0005767;C0005767;C2948600;C2948600;C3540676;C0376495;C0032105;C0022646;C0084688;C2946261;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495,2.0,3.0,-1,0.0,0.0,0.0007186290498142888,0.002238109850535877,0,0

NCT01550640,Pharmacogenetics of Remifentanil in Patients With Hypertension Undergoing Cesarean Delivery Under General Anesthesia,Caesarean delivery under general anaesthesia (GA) carries nowadays still 25% risk of      insufficient depth of anaesthesia in a time before the fetus delivery. The reason is the lack      of opioid administration. Opioids easily cross placental barrier and negatively influence      newborn postpartum adaptation by respiratory depression. Introduction to GA is thus      accompanied by exaggerated autonomic stress reaction with hypertension and tachycardia. The      use of ultra-short acting opioid remifentanil should suppress stress response in mother      without increasing the risk for newborn. There are only a few clinical data available. This      study will be the first one systematically studying the influence of remifentanil in pregnant      women with hypertension on hemodynamic stability and newborns safety.

NCT02272283,Optical Coherence Tomography Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Stent Implantation,"~     Coronary artery disease is one of the most prevalent diseases in the western countries.~      A waxy substance called plaque can build up inside the coronary arteries. Over time, plaque~     can harden or rupture, and cause narrowing (stenosis) of the arteries and reduce the flow of~     oxygen-rich blood to the heart.~      The standard treatment of symptomatic coronary stenosis is percutaneous coronary intervention~     (PCI) with balloon dilation followed by stent implantation.~      A stent is a small metallic grid that stabilizes the coronary vessel wall after the balloon~     dilation.~      Currently, drug-eluting stents (DES) are the most widely used stent types. DESs consist of a~     metallic backbone and an antiprolifetive drug-coating bound by a polymer (glue). These~     devices have reduced the incidence of excessive formation of new tissue (in-stent restenosis)~     dramatically in comparison with previously used bare-metal stents.~      However, there are safety concerns with DES, since later thrombotic events have been~     reported.~      On one hand excessive tissue formation inside the stent can cause in-stent restenosis, and on~     the other hand insufficient coverage of the stent can cause persistently exposed metalllic~     material that can induce platelet aggregation and thrombus-formation.~      The etiology to stent thrombosis is multifactorial. Possible predisposing factors are, among~     others: 1) hypersensitivity towards the polymer-coating, which may induce delayed healing~     inside and around the stent, and 2) insufficient contact between the stent and the underlying~     coronary vessel wall (incomplete stent apposition), which may cause flow-disturbance and~     delayed healing.~      Delayed healing causes persistently exposed metallic material that can induce platelet~     aggregation and thrombus-formation.~      The Nobori stent is a new-generation DES, coated with a thin layer of drug and a~     bioabsorbable polymer. The drug is localized on the outer side of the stent, and decreases~     the release of drug to the blood circulation. The bioabsorbable polymer is degraded after 6-9~     months after implantation, and decreases the risk of hypersensitivity-reactions in the vessel~     wall.~      The improved pharmacokinetic profile of the stent is thought to improve the healing pattern.~      At routine coronary angiography, a small plastic tube is inserted in the femoral artery under~     local anesthesia. Thin, flexible catheters are then advanced through the artery system~     (femoral artery and aorta) to the coronary arteries. Contrast is injected in to the blood~     stream by the catheters, and the arteries are depicted by a special X-ray technique during~     dye-release. By angiography, the outer sides of the coronary arteries are visualized, and~     balloon dilations and stent implantations are guided by this standard technique.~      Newer studies have documented that stent placement and expansion is superiorly visualized if~     supplementary intravascular imaging is performed during stent implantation.~      Small imaging catheters are wired through the vessel after stent implantation, and film the~     stent retrogradely through the vessel.~      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) visualizes the complete vessel wall by use of sound waves,~     and stent expansion is evaluated in detail.~      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a newer light-based, high-resolution technology. The~     technique can depict every thread (strut) from the stent, enabling visualization of both~     contact between struts and underlying vessel wall immediately after the procedure, and strut~     coverage at follow-up.~      The purpose of this study is to determine whether OCT-guided PCI can improve healing and~     coverage of the stent in comparison with routine angiographic guidance alone in patients~     indicating PCI due to myocardial infarction.~      If OCT-guidance improves coverage of the stent, this might lower the later thrombotic risk.~      Patients hospitalized due to myocardial infarction are randomized either to OCT-guided or~     angio-guided stent implantation in the present study. In both groups the Nobori stent is~     implanted according to standard techniques. In the angio-guided group, implantations are~     guided by angiography alone. OCT- and IVUS analysis are performed after an angiographic~     optimal result for documentary reasons. The operator is blinded towards the image findings,~     and analysis is performed offline later.~      In the OCT-guided group, both OCT and IVUS analysis is interpreted immediately after the~     acquisition. If stent apposition and/or expansion is deemed suboptimal, additional balloon~     dilation and/or stenting is performed. In case of OCT-driven stent optimization, a~     documentary OCT and IVUS is performed to document the final result.~      Patients are readmitted 6 months later for a control angiogram inclusive OCT to assess stent~     coverage.~      Furthermore, patients are readmitted 12 months after the index procedure for a control~     angiogram including OCT and IVUS to assess dynamic vessel wall responses.~   ",C1532338;C0040395,C1456025;C1956346;C0027051;C0085532;C0002921;C0040053;C1301725;C0040395;C0002978;C0002978;C0003842;C1261287;C0003842;C1261287;C0087086;C0332149;C0087086;C0184511;C0003842;C0003842;C0003842;C1171285;C2348535;C3203359;C0150312;C0030054;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0005767;C0005767;C0003483;C1704922;C0918012;C0018563;C0018563;C1532338;C0027051;C0004704;C1301746;C0012634;C0184511;C0184511;C0004704;C0148346;C0577620;C0577620;C1522577;C1261287;C0005767;C1449882;C1449882;C2947996;C2947996;C2947996;C2947996;C2947996;C0184511;C1630418;C0376495;C0012725,0.0,0.0,-1,4.0,4.0,0.0023668639053254304,0.0013996758795470894,0,0

Poor treatment adherence may be due to lack of~     sufficient patient education, time delays in delivery of care, lack of adequate healthcare~     coordination, or difficulty accessing various healthcare providers across a front desk which~     serves as a healthcare bottle-neck. Better efficiency in healthcare delivery, with greater~     connectivity through knowledgeable and trained peer volunteers and cheap cell-phones~     integrated by a smart telephone exchange may alleviate some of the care and communication~     burden faced by the healthcare system.
