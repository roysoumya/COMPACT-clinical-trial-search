NCT00034060,The Role of Cytokines on Growth Hormone Suppression in Premenopausal Women With Rheumatoid Arthritis and the Effect of Treatment With Etanercept,"This study has two phases. Phase 1 will examine the role of inflammatory mediators called      cytokines on growth hormone levels in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Phase 2 will      evaluate the effect of etanercept on these growth hormone levels. Etanercept is approved for      the treatment of RA. It lowers the levels of a key inflammatory mediator called tumor      necrosis factor-alpha and is very effective in reducing arthritis symptoms.      Growth hormone promotes bone and muscle growth. With aging, people lose muscle mass and bone      strength, possibly because of decreased levels of growth hormone. People with RA have bone      and muscle changes similar to those in older people, perhaps also due to decreased levels of      growth hormone. The first part of this study will see if the inflammatory mediators      responsible for joint inflammation (warmth, redness, pain, and swelling) in RA are related to      the lowered growth hormone levels in this disease. The second part will evaluate the effect      of etanercept treatment on muscle mass and bone density, in addition to growth hormone      levels.      Premenopausal women between 18 and 55 years of age with a recent diagnosis of rheumatoid      arthritis (less than 3 years) are eligible for this study. Healthy volunteers will also be      enrolled in the first phase of the study as control subjects. This study is conducted at two      sites, the NIH and the Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore.      Healthy volunteers enrolled in this study will be interviewed about their health status and      will fill out questionnaires on diet and general physical function, including fatigue, energy      and well being. In addition, they will be hospitalized once at the NIH Clinical Center for      24-hour blood sampling and will visit to Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore for a      brachial artery reactivity study, as follows:        -  24-hour blood sampling for growth hormone levels. Blood samples (1/2 teaspoon each) will           be collected every 20 minutes from 8 AM one day until 8 AM the following day through a           plastic tube in an arm vein.        -  Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan on a small area of the spine, hip and wrist           to assess bone density and a total body DEXA scan to assess the amount and distribution           of muscle and body fat.        -  Blood vessel (brachial artery reactivity) study to measure the ability of the brachial           artery to dilate and increase its blood flow. For this procedure, the subject lies on a           table with electrocardiogram leads attached to the chest. A blood pressure cuff is           inflated for several minutes and a drop of nasal spray of nitroglycerin is given that           may cause a headache. Blood pressure and headache are monitored and treated as needed.      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis will be seen at the NIH clinic on six separate visits      (weeks 0, 1, 6, 12, 18, and 26) over 26 weeks. Week 0 is a screening visit. At weeks 1 and      26, patients will be admitted to the hospital for 24-hour blood sampling, DEXA scans, and      brachial artery reactivity tests, as described above, plus X-rays of the hand and feet. After      the first visit, they will start taking etanercept, given by self-injection under the skin      (like insulin shots) twice a week. Follow-up visits at weeks 6, 12, and 18 will involve      evaluations of disease activity and drug side effects through joint examination, blood tests,      and questionnaires.",C0003873;C0037663;C0279752;C0301625;C0717758;C1524094;C0087111;C3871154,C0428400;C0428400;C0428400;C0428400;C0003873;C0003873;C0180208;C0741237;C0003864;C0516981;C0013798;C0041755;C0562263;C0006087;C0006087;C0006087;C0169964;C0037663;C0037663;C0037663;C0034394;C0190979;C0190979;C0005823;C0190979;C0034394;C0279752;C0017887;C0005938;C0701159;C0005938;C0005847;C0240417;C1273518;C0240417;C0220825;C0018941;C0717758;C0717758;C0717758;C0232338;C0717758;C0127400;C0087111;C0442797;C0442797;C0127400;C0087111;C0011900;C0003864;C1510486;C0184661;C0199230;C0021485;C0127400;C0038999;C4684790;C4684790;C3272565;C0226792;C0015665;C0018681;C0018681;C0184666;C0332575;C0012634;C0199168;C0015672;C0199168;C0021641;C0012634;C1518681;C0018270;C0392197;C1518681;C3810851;C0424589;C3810851;C3810851;C0424589;C0003842;C0700124;C0947630;C0027651;C0439095;C0001811;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C1512346;C0947630;C0005767;C1306645;C0037949;C0043262;C0947630;C1706074;C0817096;C0028429;C3244317;C1512346;C0441633;C0392366;C1512346;C1552850;C3244317;C1704326;C0262950;C0262950;C0262950;C0030193;C0175730;C1554184;C0441633;C0018563;C0016504;C1551994;C1561540;C0042789;C1561538;C1561538;C0019552;C0589121;C0581668;C0581668;C0086972;C1550655;C0000589;C1378698;C0233492;C3540799;C0935630;C0442743;C0442743;C0442743;C3840554;C0683314;C1524094;C0224240;C0449878;C1512346;C1306645;C1555709;C0233601;C3843322;C0030695;C0220825;C1334928;C0332149;C0220825;C4049938;C0886384;C0886384;C0332155;C0600109,0.0,0.0,0,4.0,4.0,0.0015978930312343625,0.00281648112422962,0,1

NCT00234234,Predictors of the Response to Adalimumab in Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease which is      characterized by joint inflammation (clinical involvement), by osteo-cartilaginous lesions      (structural damage) and generally by bone involvement. All those features lead to great      disability. Because it represents a major problem of the public health care system, RA has      been selected as one of the main objectives of the government for the next five years.      RA patients who do not respond to DMARDs require a treatment by TNF-a blocking agents.      However, no information is available to predict the clinical, structural and bone responses      to those new drugs that can be responsible of severe side-effects. Moreover, they are      particularly expensive since their yearly cost is estimated between 75000 and 112500 k euros      for the G4 region.      The purpose of the present research project is to determine potential predictive factors of      the response to a new TNF-a blocker ie adalimumab. To address this question, several      investigations will be performed including measurement of different blood markers,      particularly bone markers, well-defined autoantibodies and new autoantibody populations      identified by proteomic analysis, large-scale analysis of gene expression with cDNA arrays      from blood mononuclear cells, and use of different imaging tools.      The criteria of judgement will be the clinical, structural and bone responses to those new      agents.      This study requires the recruitment of about 100 patients receiving adalimumab for a 1-year      period.      At the end of the study, we hope to identify predictive factors of the response to      adalimumab, which will lead to a better management of this TNF-a blocker. Indeed, they will      be prescribed only for the patients who are likely to respond to those drugs. Thus, this      study should allow to elaborate theranostic algorithms. Such an approach will have great      benefits for the patients: more rapid efficacy, less severe side-reactions and lower costs.",C0003873;C1122087;C1704632,C0003873;C0003864;C0035435;C0699943;C0181734;C1273518;C0271510;C0231170;C0018017;C1122087;C0185117;C1122087;C1122087;C0376636;C0278329;C0002045;C0087111;C0022423;C1704632;C1704632;C0221198;C0033213;C0150312;C1442065;C0079595;C3245511;C0010957;C0205082;C0025344;C0332148;C0205082;C0013227;C0005767;C0175659;C0005767;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C0262950;C1442948;C0262950;C0262950;C0392347;C1442948;C1578513;C1578513;C1578513;C1578513;C0683956;C0683956;C1552578;C1704632;C1704632;C3245501;C3242430;C1513475;C1518681;C0005516;C4684637;C1550043;C0000828;C0442743;C0202165;C3858576;C0242708;C0015733;C1254223;C3541930;C3272565;C3272565;C1522634;C3272565;C3245501;C1272321;C4082977,0.0,0.0,0,11.0,3.6666666666666696,0.0022357737651099623,0.0023784973908038114,0,1

NCT01641705,Analysis of Respiratory Mechanics in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology characterized by      peripheral polyarthritis, symmetric, which leads to joint destruction and deformity. It is      estimated that the RA reaches about 0.5% of the population. According to data from DATASUS,      was responsible for 26,671 hospitalizations, 229 deaths and cost exceeding R$ 20 million in      2005-2007.      The main bodily changes are related to joint problems, however, systemic manifestations are      also found in organs such as lung and heart. Although cardiovascular diseases are the most      responsible of the deaths AR, pulmonary complications are common and account for 10% to 15%      of all mortality. Anaya and colleagues point out that the pulmonary involvement contributes      significant morbidity and mortality in these patients. Although pulmonary involvement is a      frequent manifestation in RA, the prevalence and nature of rheumatoid lung disease has not      yet been precisely established. Several lung disorders such as interstitial pulmonary      fibrosis, pulmonary nodules and bronchiolitis may ocorrer1. Laitinen et al point out that      studies of lung function appear to be a valuable helper for radiography in the evaluation of      pulmonary involvement in connective tissue diseases. Previous studies indicate that patients      with RA have an increased incidence of abnormal lung function, according to assessments      including spirometry, lung volume tests and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide.      Thus, the main objective of this study is to analyze the respiratory mechanics of patients      with RA. Specific objectives were to seek to understand whether a relationship exists between      duration of rheumatoid disease and lung function in these patients.      For this, the investigators used 18 subjects in the control group, free of pulmonary disease      and / or heart, all nonsmokers. In the RA group, a total of 72 patients divided into 4 groups      of 18 volunteers each, classified according to disease duration (0-5 years, 6-10 years, 11-15      years and> or = 16 years). It is noteworthy that all patients in the RA group will also be      non-smokers, since it is already known in the literature that smoking impairs lung function.      All individuals will perform the function test with a trained technician and qualified to      function.

NCT01205854,Aiming for Remission in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) - the ARCTIC Trial,"The ultimate goal of treatment in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is remission, i.e. an      absence of signs and symptoms of the disease. However, the optimal way of reaching this goal      is not known.      Ultrasonography (US) is an imaging modality which application is rapidly growing. It has a      number of advantages over other advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance      imaging (MRI), including low cost, good accessibility, and ability to scan many joints in a      short period of time.

Early treatment of RA      patients with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) significantly decreases these      complications. Methotrexate (MTX) is an excellent, economical first-line DMARD used to treat      a majority of RA patients. While most patients respond well to MTX, many continue to have      active disease. Therefore, understanding how to best treat RA patients with active disease      despite MTX therapy is critically important. Although a number of therapies with      significantly different economic implications have been shown to be effective when added to      MTX, no trial has directly compared active therapies. This study will compare therapeutic      strategies using two regimens with proven efficacy when added to MTX therapy; a)      hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine (cost ~ $1000 per year); b) the tumor necrosis factor      inhibitor, etanercept (cost ~ $12,000 per year).      We propose a bi-national multi-center randomized, double-blind equivalency trial comparing      (A) the strategy of initially adding hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine to MTX in patients      with active disease despite MTX, with a switch at 24 weeks to etanercept in nonresponders to      (B) a strategy of adding etanercept to MTX, with a switch to hydroxychloroquine and      sulfasalazine in nonresponders at 24 weeks. If we find that the strategy of first adding      hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine to MTX identifies a subset of responsive patients and      that there is no harm to nonresponders because of early rescue with etanercept, then this      less expensive option should become the standard treatment for MTX resistant patients.      Four hundred and fifty RA patients with active disease despite treatment with MTX as      indicated by a Disease Activity Score with 28 joints (DAS28) of >4.4 units will be      randomized. A DAS improvement of <1.2 (validated as clinically significant) at 24 weeks will      be used to identify early nonresponder who will switch therapy. Subjects with a DAS28      improvement of > 1.2 at 24 weeks will remain on their initial therapy. The primary endpoint      is the change of DAS 28 scores from baseline to 48 weeks. The secondary endpoint is      comparison of radiographic progression of disease at 48 weeks, as measured by the change in      Sharp score. Economic and functional outcomes will be assessed and a serum and DNA bank will      be established to evaluate potential biomarkers predictive of treatment response/toxicity and      disease progression. This trial will recruit 450 subjects over 40 months. At the end of the      48 week blinded active therapy portion of the trial, the blind will be broken and data will      be collected in an open fashion until all 450 patients have completed the 48 week portion of      the trial.",C0003873;C0025677;C0087111;C0012634;C0087111;C0718247;C0718247;C1550655;C0882214,C1290886;C0003873;C0003191;C0242656;C0020336;C0020336;C0020336;C0020336;C4684780;C2986535;C0333516;C0009566;C0162340;C0036078;C0036078;C0036078;C0036078;C0025677;C1261381;C0242656;C0679199;C0717758;C0717758;C0717758;C0717758;C0005516;C0220880;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0027627;C0087111;C2945654;C0679199;C0679199;C0679199;C4049938;C1704632;C0600688;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C0087111;C0087111;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C0087111;C0087111;C0012634;C0087111;C0700164;C0242708;C0947630;C0456909;C4050231;C1444775;C0229671;C0456909;C1273517;C1561543;C1561543;C1273517;C1561540;C3245479;C1561540;C0025677;C0025677;C0025677;C0025677;C0025677;C0025677;C0025677;C0025677;C0025677;C0025677;C0025677;C0175454;C0175454;C0087111;C1306645;C0237284;C1320102;C1320102;C1320102;C0776963;C1320102;C0776963;C0776963;C1320102;C1320102;C0600091;C0562230;C0009566;C3844714;C3844714;C0442797;C4084912;C1514892;C3858576;C0242708;C1561542;C0776963;C0018792;C0776963;C0404831;C0018792;C3534109;C0018792;C0018792;C0018792;C3854058;C0728774;C0220825;C0069695,426.0,43218.0,0,65.0,16.25,0.0025254604247820773,0.00325058630287342,0,0

NCT01583959,Study of Different Doses of Folic Acid in Combination With Methotrexate in Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Introduction: Methotrexate is the sheet anchor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.      Folic acid supplementation is usually given at a dose of 5-30 mg per week to ameliorate      adverse effects. Patients at our center are usually on the higher dose. However, it is      unclear if higher doses are required, recent international recommendations suggest 5-10 mg      per week only.      Objectives: To randomize rheumatoid patients being being started on Methotrexate into 2      groups- one on 5mg for 6 days a week (30mg per week) of folic acid and the other 5 mg twice a      week (10 mg per week) for 24weeks. To look at difference in        1. Adverse effects due to methotrexate           a. Minor adverse effects: By symptom chart           a. Major adverse effects: Cytopenia (predefined) and transaminitis.        2. Disease activity using Disease activity score 28 joints (3 variable) and functional           status by health assessment questionnaire        3. RBC folic acid levels Methodology: Randomised controlled trial, double blinded, placebo           controlled. Sample size 50 in each group. One group of patients will receive folic acid           5 mg twice a week with placebo for 4 days and the other group will receive folic acid 5           mg 6 days a week for 24 weeks.      Patients will be administered adverse effects proforma, assessed for having cytopenias and      transaminitis (pre defined) and disease activity will be calculated at every visit, ie., in      the beginning at then at 8,16 and 24 weeks. In addition will look at the functional status      and RBC folate levels at 0 and 24 weeks.

NCT01722617,A Study to Validate Questionnaires FLARE and OM-RA-FLARE Measuring Disease Flares in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a rheumatic inflammatory synovitis characterized by pain and      joint swelling as well as thickening synovial (pannus) lesions that are responsible of      osteocartilaginous and tendon damage. It evolves in spurts or long and variable intensity      interspersed with remissions.      The effectiveness of treatment is based on the proportion of patients who achieve a certain      degree of improvement over the initial level of various parameters such as response criteria      ACR 20, 50 or 70% or EULAR based on the evolution of DAS 28 or DAS 44. These response      criteria are now well validated but do not fully take into account the improvement of the      patient's condition. In contrast, there is no questionnaire to identify the proportion of      patients whose RA worsened between the medical visits. Such a questionnaire is necessary to      detect flares outbreaks in daily practice and in randomized clinical trials, follow-up      studies or longitudinal studies after drugs marketing to detect a reversal of disease      activity.

NCT01969604,Reduction of Daily Sitting Time in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Background:      In recent years there has been a growing interest in sedentary behaviour defined as      activities performed in sitting or lying position during waking hours. Sedentary behaviour      has been recognised as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and mortality.      A few intervention studies in older sedentary people and in overweight or obese adults have      demonstrated, that daily sitting time can be reduced through behavioural intervention.      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases,      partly caused by the rheumatic disease itself but also because of physical inactivity.      Studies have documented a positive effect of increasing physical activity on pain and      physical functioning in patients with RA. However, the studies also show, that the patients      find it difficult to maintain the increased physical activity levels over time. Previous      studies suggest that in promoting health among patients with mobility disability should not      solely focus on increasing moderate to vigorous physical activity but also target reduction      of sedentary behaviour and increase of light physical activity. In the present study we will      focus on reduction of daily sitting time and increase of light physical activity as this      approach may prove more feasible for patients with RA.      Objectives and hypothesises:      We hypothesise, that sedentary behaviour can be reduced in patients with RA through a      behavioural lifestyle change. In addition, we hypothesize, that reduction of daily sitting      time can have a positive effect on symptoms and general health in patients with RA.      The primary objective of the present intervention study is to investigate the effect of a      motivational counselling intervention on daily sitting time in adult men and women with RA.      Furthermore we want to investigate whether a reduction in daily sitting time is related to      reduction in pain and fatigue, reduced weight and waist circumference and improved quality of      life, physical function and improved cardiovascular biomarker levels (cholesterol and blood      pressure).      Study setting and allocation:      In total, 150 participants will be recruited from the rheumatology outpatient clinic at      Glostrup University Hospital, Denmark. The participants will be allocated to either an      intervention group (75) or a control group (75).      Intervention:      The intervention aims to support and strengthen the participants' belief in their own ability      to reduce their daily sitting time. The intervention will include 1) three individual      motivational counselling sessions (60-90 minutes), conducted by one of four project nurses in      combination with 2)Individual Short Text Messages (SMS). The counselling sessions will focus      on information about the positive health effects of reducing daily sitting time and the      participants' own goals of reducing their sitting time. Based on the goals the participants      will receive weekly SMS reminders.      Data collection:      Measurements on all participants will be done four times during 22 months; 1) at baseline, 2)      16 weeks after start (by the end of the intervention), 3) six months after end of      intervention and 4) 18 months after end of intervention. At each of the four visits the      participants fill in questionnaires regarding demographics, lifestyle, daily sitting time,      physical activity, physical function, pain , fatigue and quality of life. Furthermore, two      occupational therapists will measure the participants' blood pressure, height, weight and      waist circumference. At the same time a little monitor will be placed on the participants'      thigh, which they will carry for seven days. The monitor measures the participants' physical      activity level. The four measurements also include a blood sample from the participants in      order to measure cholesterol levels.",C0003873;C1293152;C0277814;C1550655,C0007222;C0007222;C1096775;C0003873;C0455829;C0455829;C1096775;C0201950;C0035435;C0516981;C0516981;C0683317;C0518214;C0424575;C3887460;C0034394;C0005823;C0683317;C3178910;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0178913;C1290940;C0035648;C0010210;C0010210;C0010210;C0497406;C1301725;C0231170;C0332218;C4551656;C4551656;C4551656;C0018017;C4551656;C4551656;C0005516;C0543488;C1446409;C0425245;C1446409;C0184511;C0184511;C0460139;C1446409;C0277814;C0277814;C0947630;C0947630;C0150312;C0277814;C0277814;C0150312;C0277814;C0277814;C0015672;C0542559;C0277814;C0277814;C0277814;C0277814;C0015672;C0030695;C0030695;C0442696;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C1305866;C1305866;C0028754;C0947630;C0005767;C0947630;C0018017;C0018017;C1552850;C0039866;C0699809;C0030193;C0030193;C0030193;C3539181;C0018017;C0677505;C0677505;C0677505;C0677505;C4699158;C0516981;C1550655;C1457887;C3242430;C0026605;C0026605;C0201950;C0034770;C4684637;C0233492;C1518681;C0474395;C1318464;C4034481;C0178520;C0178520;C0178520;C3843236;C1555588;C0231519;C0233697;C0233697;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1512346;C1555709;C0275586;C0275586;C0700164;C1552839;C1552839;C1522411;C0221106;C1714809;C4697740;C0031809;C0031809;C0728774;C0031809;C0677505;C0677505;C0151576,0.0,0.0,0,9.0,3.0,0.0021963041927397305,0.0021185029605025802,0,0

The immune      system attacks the joint synovium, which damages the cartilage and bone in the joint by      increasing the number of inflammatory cells and forming new blood vessels in the joint space.      STA-5326 mesylate inhibits the production of IL-12 and IL-23 and therefore may inhibit Th-1      cytokine production. A reduction in the Th-1 response has the potential to minimize or      eliminate joint damage caused by the immune response in rheumatoid arthritis.

NCT01198509,Role of Oral and Intestinal Microbiota in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA),"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory form of arthritis that causes joint pain and      damage. RA attacks the lining of the joints (synovium), causing swelling that can result in      aching and throbbing, and eventually deformity. Even though there have been many advances in      the treatment of RA, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and other inflammatory arthritis, doctors      still do not know what causes this inflammation in joints. It is likely that RA occurs as a      result of a complex combination of factors, including a person's genes; lifestyle choices,      such as smoking and diet; and things in a person's environment, including bacteria or      viruses. This study investigates the hypothesis that bacteria living in a person's mouth      and/or intestinal tract are responsible, at least in part, for the development of Rheumatoid      Arthritis.

NCT02164214,Does Etanercept Influence Tweak Modulation of Inflammation During Inflammatory Rheumatisms (Psoriatic Arthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis)?,"TWEAK (TNF weakly inducer of apoptosis) is a type II-transmembrane protein, member of the TNF      ligand superfamily that can be cleaved to function as a soluble cytokine. Depending on target      cell type, TWEAK triggers multiple cellular responses ranging from modulation of inflammation      to cell death when it binds to its main receptor, Fn 14. Our team has been the first to      describe pro-inflammatory effects of TWEAK during central nervous system inflammation.      Various data support the possibility that TWEAK produced by synovial macrophages may      contribute to chronic synovitis in animal models and in humans. In psoriatic arthritis      (PsoA), anti-TNF therapy has been successful concording with the key role of TNF in the      pathogenesis of this disease and the generation by psoriatic patients of neutralizing      anti-TNF autoantibodies referred as ""beneficial autoimmunity to pro-inflammatory mediators"".

NCT00803257,Effect of Lumbrical Stretching on Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,"~     Symptoms of CTS occur when any condition decreases the size of the carpal canal or increases~     the volume of the structures within the carpal canal, compressing the median nerve. One cause~     of the symptoms of CTS is the incursion of the lumbrical muscles of the hand into the carpal~     canal. Individuals with CTS tend to have tight lumbrical muscles which increase this~     incursion, thereby increasing CTS symptoms. An intervention designed to reduce the incursion~     of the lumbrical muscles should have an effect on the symptoms of CTS.~      The purpose of this study is to systematically examine the effect of an intensive lumbrical~     muscle intervention, splinting to prevent lumbrical muscle incursion and lumbrical muscle~     exercises, on the symptoms of CTS. This project will be a randomized clinical trial to~     evaluate the effectiveness of a home program targeting the lumbrical muscles.
