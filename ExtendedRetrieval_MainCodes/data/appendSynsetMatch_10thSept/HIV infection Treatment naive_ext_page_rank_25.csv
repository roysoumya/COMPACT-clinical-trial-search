NCT03571204,Combination Therapy With 3BNC117 and 10-1074 in HIV-Infected Individuals,"~     Background:~      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects the immune system. The main function of the immune~     system is protect you from infections and other diseases such as cancer. HIV attacks and~     cripples the immune system making people more susceptible to a variety of infections and~     cancers. Currently, the standard treatment for HIV infection is a daily administration of~     anti-HIV drugs. These drugs are called combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART is very~     effective at suppressing HIV, but does not cure HIV infection. ART must be taken continuously~     for life to be effective. ART can stop being effective if not taken correctly and can cause~     permanent side effects. Researchers want to see if two new products can control HIV infection~     without the use of ART. The products are the antibodies 3BNC117 and 10-1074.~      Objective:~      To see if 3BNC117 and 10-1074 are safe and can control HIV levels in the blood of people who~     are not taking ART or people who stop taking their ART during the study. .~      Eligibility:~      Adults ages 18-65 with HIV who are:~        -  on ART and willing to stop treatment for at least 28 weeks~        -  OR not taking ART with low levels of HIV in the blood~      Design:~      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood, heart, and~     urine tests.~      Participants will get the 2 study products or salt water (placebo).

Some of~     the white blood cells will be separated from the blood and used for research studies to see~     how 3BNC117 and 10-1074 effects HIV and the immune system. The rest of the blood will be~     returned to the person through another needle in the arm.~      Participants will have 18 study visits over 28 weeks.

NCT01683656,ER Niacin/Laropiprant Impact on Cardiovascular Markers and Atheroprogression in HIV-infected Individuals on cART,"~     HIV-infected patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Large investigations~     support an inverse correlation between HDL-C levels and coronary heart disease.

NCT00013520,Comparison of Three Different Initial Treatments Without Protease Inhibitors for HIV Infection,"The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of 3      anti-HIV combination treatments that do not use protease inhibitors (PIs).      The current rule for starting treatment of HIV infection is to combine members from different      classes of anti-HIV drugs, such as 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and      either a PI or a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). However, these      combinations can be complicated and difficult to take, can cause a number of side effects,      and may become ineffective. Combinations that are simpler, better tolerated, and more      effective are needed. Because PIs can cause long-term side effects and because HIV can become      resistant to many of them at the same time, anti-HIV combination treatments that do not use      PIs are being tested.",C0033607;C0019693;C0087111;C0882214,C0282519;C0282519;C0033607;C4553491;C0019693;C3539181;C0877248;C0877248;C0087111;C3242385;C0087111;C3242385;C0087111;C0332218;C0456387;C0392366;C0947630;C0013227;C0870077;C3811910;C3539181;C3539181;C4684765;C1514892;C0034770,0.0,0.0,1,206.0,41.2,0.03958582677476473,0.039840395666107926,2,2
