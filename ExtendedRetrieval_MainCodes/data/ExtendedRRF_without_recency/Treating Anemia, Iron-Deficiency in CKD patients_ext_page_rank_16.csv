NCT01001871,Treatment of Iron Deficiency Anemia in Malaria Endemic Ghana,"Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are the most prevalent micronutrient      deficiencies on a worldwide basis, especially in developing countries. The impact of severe      IDA can have mortal consequences, since without adequate hemoglobin, the brain and body      become deprived of oxygen and, if allowed to continue, death may ensue. It has been shown      that iron supplementation in infants and young children can enhance child development,      however, it may also result in increased rates of malaria in high burden areas.      The primary objective of this study is to determine the impact of providing encapsulated iron      (as a powder added to complementary foods) on the susceptibility to clinical malaria among      anemic and non-anemic infants and young children (6-24 months of age) living in a high      malaria burden area.      The value of performing this research in Ghana is primarily that malaria and anemia remain      the most important causes of death and morbidity.",C0162316;C0087111;C0024530,C0162316;C0008071;C0240066;C0242297;C0007465;C0012655;C1333381;C0018017;C0220880;C0024530;C0024530;C0024530;C0024530;C0205082;C0030054;C0857322;C0857322;C0002871;C0006104;C0011065;C0947630;C0302583;C0302583;C0948093;C0342917;C0699530;C4084912;C1561542;C0729829;C0776963;C3272565;C0151576;C4082977,0,0,0,45,15.0,0.07038439099999999,0.060960659,0,0,0.12902057374674009
NCT01700426,"Enhancing Treatment of Iron Deficiency and Iron Deficiency Anemia With an Antioxidant, Vitamin E","The study addresses treatment of iron deficiency, the most common nutritional deficiency that      infants and young children encounter. With the knowledge that iron deficiency may      irreversibly affect a baby's long-term neurodevelopment and behavior, the investigators are      offering free screening blood draws at Children's Hospital Colorado to older babies and      toddlers (9-24 months old). If their blood results indicate a serum ferritin of = 15      micrograms/dL without the presence of an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), they will be      invited to continue in the intervention portion of the study, where they will receive iron      supplements as well as vitamin E (or placebo) for an eight week treatment period.

NCT01542879,Development of Radiation Free Whole Body Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging Technique for Staging Children With Cancer,"~     A research study on the diagnosis of spread of disease for children who have been diagnosed~     with solid tumors using a new whole body imaging technique and a new MR contrast agent~     (ferumoxytol). Standard tests that are used to determine the extent and possible spread of a~     child's disease include magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, computed tomography (CT), Positron~     Emission Tomography (PET) as well as bone scanning, and metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)~     scanning. The purpose of this study is to determine if newer imaging tests referred to as~     whole body diffusion-weighted MR and whole body PET/MR can detect the extent and spread of~     the disease as accurately or even better as the standard tests (CT, MR and/or PET/CT). The~     advantage of the new imaging test is that it is associated with no or significantly reduced~     radiation exposure compared to standard CT and PET/CT imaging tests. The results of whole~     body MR and PET/MR will be compared with that of the conventional, standard imaging studies~     for tumor detecting.~   ",C0079595,C0060274;C0040395;C0040395;C0011900;C0332149;C0441633;C0441633;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C0079595;C0544452,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0625,0.027511276,0,0,0.10096153846153846
