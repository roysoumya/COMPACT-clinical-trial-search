NCT01385995,Effects of Treatment of Sleep Apnea on Metabolic Syndrome,"The investigators performed a randomized, cross-over controlled clinical trial comparing 8      weeks of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) to 8 weeks of sham-CPAP in patients with      moderate to severe Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) and impaired glucose tolerance. A      rigorous assessment of metabolic responses to SDB treatment in this group is of great      clinical significance because this sample is at high risk for developing diabetes.

NCT01578031,The Effects of Treating Obese and Lean Patients With Sleep Apnea,"The investigators' overall goal is to compare the effect of CPAP treatment on intermediate      cardiovascular risk measures in obese versus lean patients with obstructive sleep apnea      (OSA). The overall hypothesis is that, adjusting for OSA severity and obtaining normative      data from non-OSA subjects with comparable amounts of visceral adiposity, the two OSA groups      will have comparable improvements in daytime sleepiness, but that the cardiovascular and      metabolic improvements following CPAP therapy will be decreased in OSA patients with      increased visceral adipose tissue. The investigators anticipate that, although there will be      a greater absolute change in markers of sympathetic activity, inflammation and oxidative      stress in obese compared to lean OSA patients following CPAP treatment, the levels will still      be abnormally high in the obese patients resulting in the decreased improvements in insulin      resistance, arterial blood pressure, and vascular health in obese versus lean OSA patients.",C0037315;C0028754;C1550655,C0520679;C1272641;C0541854;C3887460;C3887460;C0021368;C0087111;C0028754;C0442797;C0087111;C0442797;C0005847;C0087111;C0021641;C1518681;C1552839;C0038435;C0028754;C0028754;C0028754;C0028754;C0018017;C3245479;C0042779;C0042779;C1550465;C0005516;C0237834;C0205161;C2707259;C4049938;C3840775;C0151576,106,3360,0,0,0,0.010004703,0.006864644,0,1,0.037026783

NCT01896661,Effect of Antihypertensive Agents Over Sleep Apnea,"Obstructive sleep apnea and hypertension are well-known cardiovascular risk factors. Their      control could reduce the burden of heart disease across populations. There are several drugs      to control hypertension, but the only consistently beneficial treatment to reduce apneas is      continuous positive airway pressure. The demonstration that one drug could improve sleep      apnea and hypertension would support a novel approach in the treatment of both diseases. The      role of fluid retention in sleep apnea is known for several decades. The role of diuretics is      well established in hypertension but was never appropriately tested in sleep apnea.

NCT01812993,Reversal of the Neurological Deficit in Acute Stroke With the Signal of Efficacy Trial of Auto BPAP to Limit Damage From Suspected Sleep Apnea,"Although the negative impact of sleep apnea on the clinical course of acute ischemic stroke      (AIS) is well known, data regarding non-invasive ventilation in acute patients are scarce.      Several studies showed its tolerability, safety and signals-of-efficacy, yet no controlled      randomized sequential phase studies currently exist that aim to establish the efficacy of      early non-invasive ventilation in AIS patients. The main hypothesis for this study is that      early non-invasive ventilation with automated bilevel positive airway pressure (auto-BPAP)      positively affects short-term clinical outcomes in AIS patients. This is a multicenter,      prospective, randomized, controlled, third rater-blinded, parallel-group trial. Patients with      AIS with proximal arterial obstruction and clinically suspected sleep apnea will be      randomized to standard or standard stroke care plus auto-BPAP. Auto-BPAP will be initiated      within 24 hours from stroke onset and performed for a maximum of 48 hours during diurnal and      nocturnal sleep. Patients will undergo cardiorespiratory polygraphy between day 3 and 5 to      assess sleep apnea. The primary endpoint is any early neurological improvement on the NIHSS      at 72 hours from randomization.

NCT02748681,Telemedicine Monitoring of Sleep Apnea in Stroke,"Study Objectives:      Meta-analyses report a high prevalence of moderate to severe sleep apnea of more than 50% in      stroke patients, with adherence rates for CPAP therapy of only 30%.      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether CPAP adherence in stroke patients      with obstructive sleep apnea can be improved by a CPAP training strategy during      rehabilitation combined with a telemedicine monitoring system after discharge.      The secondary objective is to compare recording quality as well as subjective and objective      sleep data of non-attended level III polygraphy, polysomnography and telemetric CPAP data in      the management of sleep apnea in stroke.      Further the investigators aim to study changes in nocturnal systolic blood pressure due to      CPAP therapy with the pulse transit time method.      Finally, the investigators intend to study the relationship between CPAP compliance, sleep      and medical and neurorehabilition outcome parameters.      Design:      Single-blind, mono-center, randomized controlled trial on standard CPAP treatment as compared      with CPAP treatment with a telemedicine monitoring system in stroke patients with moderate to      severe OSA.      Setting: Neurorehabilitation center in Vienna, Austria      Patients: Adult subacute (1 to 12 months post stroke) stroke patients 18-70 yrs of age) with      moderate to severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index (AHI) = 15/hr) determined by non-attended      polysomnography (AHI) = 15/hr of sleep) or level III polygraphy (AHI) = 30/hr of      out-of-center sleep testing (OCST), who undergo successful CPAP training and titration (goal      AHI< 10) at the neurorehabilitation unit.      Interventions: Patients will be randomized to either standard care with an autotitrating CPAP      device or an autotitrating CPAP device that transmits physiologic information (i.e.,      adherence, air leak, residual AHI) daily to a website that will be reviewed by their homecare      provider. If any problems are identified, the patient will be contacted by his homecare      provider by telephone. Neurologists performing sleep and neurological scoring will be blinded      to the randomization.      Measurements: Recording of the different measuring systems, subjective and objective sleep      quality, CPAP adherence after 3 months and 1 year in hours used per night, systolic BP      determined by means of a non-linear algorithm and an individual one-point calibration of the      pulse transit time obtained with a cuff-based BP measuring system (SOMNOmedics GmbH, Germany)      and neurorehabilitation outcome parameters as Barthel Index, Timed Up and Go Test.",C0162648;C0037315;C0150369;C0038454,C0282440;C0520679;C0871470;C0204096;C1139730;C1139730;C0162701;C0162701;C0034991;C0162701;C1273869;C0451019;C0162648;C0162648;C0037315;C0037315;C0597266;C0376636;C0597266;C0018017;C0012621;C0027627;C0018017;C0018017;C0087111;C0087111;C0162621;C0018017;C0002045;C0184511;C0679199;C2828392;C0235546;C2828392;C0282443;C1555587;C1555587;C0087111;C0087111;C4281677;C2349146;C0684224;C0205082;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0025663;C1549113;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C0038454;C0205082;C0947630;C0947630;C0037313;C0947630;C0034107;C0947630;C0037313;C0456909;C0003578;C0918012;C0037313;C0037313;C0037313;C0034107;C3245479;C3245479;C0018017;C1561543;C1273517;C0022885;C0204096;C0204096;C0018017;C4699604;C0442694;C0442694;C1550655;C1550655;C0033213;C3842480;C2707261;C3242430;C4082977;C4082977;C2979880;C3714738;C1550043;C2979880;C3843236;C1515258;C1561542;C0729829;C3245509;C1547226;C1547226;C1547226;C1995642;C0031843;C4698129;C4082977;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129,0,0,1,2,1,0.009216243,0.011237792,0,1,0.036094498

NCT01261390,Sleep Apnea Intervention for Cardiovascular Disease Reduction,"Moderate to severe sleep apnea (a high number of breathing pauses on a sleep study) is a      common health problem that is often associated with loud snoring and sleepiness.The medical      term for this problem is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). People with OSA often have an      increased risk for developing heart disease or may already have a diagnosis of heart disease.      A clinical research study is being conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Beth      Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) to compare the effects of continuous positive airway      pressure (CPAP) to conservative medical therapy with participation in one of four groups:        1. Active-PAP Therapy Group (Active-Beh or Active+Beh): Will receive standard medical           treatment for sleep apnea with active-PAP. Participants will be randomized to either:             1. Active-Pap with respiratory therapist visits only             2. Active-Pap with respiratory therapist visits and cognitive behavioral therapist                visits.        2. Alternative PAP Group (Sham): Will receive lower air delivery level than active-PAP           therapy group. Will also have meetings with respiratory therapist.        3. Conservative Medical Therapy Group (CMT)*: Will receive a free supply of nasal strips           for the duration of their treatment period (either 6 months or 12 months) and follow           healthy sleep hygiene guidelines for how to change sleep habits to minimize incidences           of apneas (breathing disturbances during sleep).

Six hundred drug~     and alcohol offenders in two probation sites (Baltimore, MD and Dallas, TX) will be~     randomized to receive: 1) an in-person motivational interviewing session (MI), 2) a~     motivational computer program (MC), or 3) supervision intake and monitoring as usual (SAU).~     The MI condition will be structured along the lines of the Check-Up format which consists~     of an assessment and personalized feedback delivered in an MI style; the content of the MC~     condition will be drawn from previous literature on effective motivational computer programs.~     Both interventions will be delivered at the start of the probation process, with follow-up~     assessments at 2 and 6 months.

NCT00701038,Diagnosis and Treatment of Sleep Apnea in the Acute Exacerbation of Heart Failure,"Congestive heart failure affects 2.3 percent of the population (approximately 4,900,000) with      an incidence of 10 per 1,000 of the population after the age of 65 (1). The admission rate      for patients with heart failure is on the rise, so is the mortality associated with it and      its national annual bill, now exceeding $21 billion (1). Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is      present in 11-37 percent of patients with heart failure (2,3), and tends to increase in      severity when the heart failure is less controlled (4, 5). Therefore, the actual prevalence      of OSA in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure is likely higher. There is now      evidence that treatment of OSA with nasal Continuous Positive Pressure (nCPAP) in outpatients      with stable heart failure improves left ventricular ejection fraction, and quality of life      (6), and confers a reduction in fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events (7). However, there      has not been any evaluation of the role of diagnosis and treatment of OSA in patients      hospitalized with acute heart failure. This uncertainty about the true prevalence and role of      OSA in exacerbations of heart failure, and the role of its treatment in the acute setting may      explain why aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for OSA in patients admitted to      the hospital with acute heart failure is not part of the standard clinical practice in acute      care centers.

NCT02264353,The Impact of Arousal Threshold in Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"~     The investigators hypothesis is that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients with a low~     arousal threshold may wake up too early during a respiratory event, before upper airway~     muscles can be activated to achieve stable ventilation. Thus, strategies to manipulate the~     respiratory arousal threshold could potentially improve the quality of sleep and sleep~     disordered breathing. Agents that raise arousal threshold are therefore likely to benefit~     some patients with OSA. The overall goal of this project is to determine the importance of~     the arousal threshold in OSA, determine which patients might benefit from a raised arousal~     threshold, and test this hypothesis by using pharmacological manipulation of the arousal~     threshold to achieve this goal.~   ",C0037315;C0003808,C0424563;C0037315;C4018905;C0003808;C0003808;C0003808;C0003808;C0003808;C0003808;C0184511;C0037313,4,410,-1,3,3,0.010962482,0.010323367,0,0,0.032782397
NCT02234765,Management of Patients With Suspected of Sleep Apnea-hypopnea Syndrome From Primary Care,"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is characterized by the manifestation of excessive      sleepiness secondary to repeated obstruction of the upper airway during sleep and      cognitive-behavioral, respiratory, cardiac, metabolic or inflammatory disorders.      Epidemiological studies in our country have shown that OSA is a highly prevalent disease in      the general population, affecting 2-4% of the adult population. The most important clinical      manifestations of OSAS is a deterioration in the quality of life and an increase in      cardiovascular disease. OSA is also associated with traffic accidents. Therefore, and      considering the medical complications of OSA, as well as the sociolaboral impact and its      negative impact on quality of life and survival; is stated that this disease is a public      health problem that requires the physician to identify patients eligible to treatment.      Moreover, it has been shown that undiagnosed patients, duplicate the consumption of health      resources, comparing when the diagnosis and treatment has been established. Finally, we have      a highly effective treatment using positive pressure in the upper airway (CPAP) that has been      shown to be effective and cost-effective. The current situation in which all patients      diagnosed with OSA and receiving different treatments are monitored and controlled by the      Sleep Units (SU) is an oversized medicine specialist at the expense of primary care (PC). Our      working hypothesis is: ""By the coordination of actions at various levels including      interactive training equipment AP, use the bilateral (SU-AP) of electronic medical records      and the use of new technologies can be achieved in AP satisfactory management of the      diagnostic and therapeutic process of patients with suspected OSA. Patients assisted in both      areas have a level of clinical response, satisfaction, compliance and avoidance of      complications, similar to that obtained with monitoring by SU.

NCT00310310,Effect of Self-Management on Improving Sleep Apnea Outcomes,"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that is associated with      serious medical and psychological complications. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure      (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for this condition because it is highly effective in      reducing the frequency of nocturnal respiratory events, improving sleep architecture,      decreasing daytime sleepiness and improving blood pressure. Incomplete patient adherence,      however, limits the effectiveness of CPAP therapy and results in sub-optimal patient      outcomes. Previous efforts to enhance CPAP adherence have resulted in only modest      improvements, have generally not been theory-driven, and have had minimal effects on key      patient outcomes such as reduction in OSA symptoms or increase in health-related quality of      life (HRQOL). The planned intervention in this proposal, the Sleep Apnea Self-Management      Program (SASMP), is based on the rationale that sleep apnea is a chronic disease that      requires significant self-care on the part of the patient. We draw on the extensive chronic      disease self-management literature to provide a solid theoretical justification for this      pragmatic intervention both to better manage key aspects of OSA and to increase CPAP      adherence. Chronic disease management programs help reduce symptoms, improve HRQOL, improve      treatment adherence, and decrease medical utilization.",C0086969;C0037315,C0199451;C1303150;C0520679;C0541854;C0086969;C0008679;C0086969;C0851578;C0005823;C1306597;C0009566;C4553491;C0184661;C0184661;C0037315;C0037315;C0442797;C0023866;C0087111;C0012634;C4551656;C3872897;C0087111;C0039082;C1948033;C0087111;C0376691;C0012634;C1547296;C3245511;C0028429;C0037313;C1552861;C0042497;C0442797;C1457887;C1457887;C1555587;C0184511;C0184511;C0015264;C1518681;C0233492;C0040399;C2347273;C0013126;C3245501;C4698437;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129,0,480,0,0,0,0.010962482,0.010573843,0,1,0.032057414

NCT00358267,Randomized Trial Comparing Partial Resection of Inferior Turbinate(PRIT) and Radiofrequency Ablation(RFA) for Inferior Turbinate Reduction,"~     Turbinates are large structures in the nasal airway that help the nose to clean and humidify~     the air we breathe. Inferior turbinates can swell up and block the breathing passage, making~     it hard to breath. To address this, turbinate size must be reduced.~      This study looks at two common procedures for turbinate reduction:~        1. Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) involves inserting a special needle into the inferior~          (lower) turbinate that releases thermal energy, which significantly reduces its size.~          This can be done under local anesthesia at the doctor's office.~        2. Partial Resection of Inferior Turbinate (PRIT) involves surgically removing a piece off~          the turbinate, which also reduces its size.~      While both procedures improve nasal obstruction, no study has directly compared which is more~     effective.~      Eighty patients being treated for septal deformity and turbinate hypertrophy will be randomly~     chosen for either PRIT or RFA treatment. They will fill out a simple, five question survey~     that measures how they view their nasal blockage 4 times in one year. We believe that since~     PRIT permanently removes a part of the turbinate, PRIT patients will report more improvement~     than RFA patients one year later. We believe that complications (measured by the doctor) will~     be the same for both treatments.~   ",0,C0002921;C0028778;C0020564;C0547070;C1442065;C0684224;C0028429;C3536832;C0009566;C0184511;C0723285;C0376495,0,0,-1,0,0,0.000897666,0.004152004,0,0,0.031237622

Increased morbidity and three to four times increased~     mortality in these patients are well documented, mainly in the cardiovascular field.~     Pharyngeal surgery, i.e. uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) opens up the airway and was the~     predominant treatment for OSAS worldwide before continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)~     devices became widely available in the 1990s. Since then, the main treatment for OSAS has~     been CPAP, but an increasing number of patients are also treated with mandibular retaining~     device (MRD). UPPP as treatment for OSAS has been performed for 30 years. The evidence-grade~     for the efficacy has so far been very low, and the side-effects and complication rate has~     raised the question whether there is a place for surgical treatment of OSAS. However, the~     compliance for CPAP and dental devices are quite low (50-60%), leaving a lot of patients~     untreated if surgery is not offered.

On an individual basis, it has been shown that a longer~     duration of CPAP use is associated with better outcomes in terms of daytime functioning and~     in the control of metabolic and blood pressure effects of CPAP. For our study, we have~     therefore decided to use 2 co-primary endpoints, taking into account both aspects of~     adherence mentioned. Cardiovascular complications are a major concern in OSAS patients.~     Effective CPAP treatment has been shown to reduce surrogate measures of cardiovascular risk.~     We hypothesize that intensified efforts for CPAP adherence with telemedicine has a positive~     impact on a number of surrogate measures of the cardiovascular risk at 1 and 6 months of~     treatment.~   ",C0162648,C0005823;C3887460;C3887460;C3887460;C0162648;C0162648;C0332149;C2926735;C2728259;C1874451;C0009566;C1446409;C3714811;C0184511;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495,0,0,-1,0,0,0.002054955,0.005083807,0,0,0.026166298

NCT00492115,Cognitive Benefits of Treating Sleep Apnea in Parkinson's Disease,"Patients with sleep disordered breathing (SDB), also called sleep apnea, experience nighttime      disrupted sleep and, because they stop breathing for short periods during the night, do not      get sufficient oxygen to their brains. This can frequently result in daytime impairments      including difficulties with memory. The state-of-the-art treatment for SDB is Continuous      Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). Many non-demented SDB patients who are successfully treated      with CPAP show improvement in memory and other cognitive functions. Data have shown that      patients with Parkinson's disease have a high rate of SDB. Patients with Parkinson's disease      also often have problems with memory. This study will test the effects of treating SDB among      patients with Parkinson's disease and SDB. Specifically, the study will test the effect of      CPAP treatment on SDB and sleep; the effect of CPAP treatment on daytime sleepiness,      cognition, overall quality of life and mood; the effect of CPAP treatment on the frequency of      symptoms of REM behavior disorder and restless legs syndrome; the effect of continued CPAP      use (beyond the six weeks of the study) on SDB, sleep, cognition, mood and quality of life;      whether the study-partner feels that CPAP improves the patient's sleep, mood and overall      functioning; whether study-partners feel that their own sleep, mood and overall functioning      improve as the patient's sleep improves both during the 6-week protocol and at follow-up for      those opting to continue using CPAP.",C0030567;C0037315,C4551689;C0035258;C0392335;C0030567;C0030567;C0030567;C0541854;C0004930;C0518083;C0518214;C0518214;C0425946;C1299586;C0037315;C0237607;C0004048;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0009240;C0087111;C0009240;C1446409;C0460139;C0860630;C0442711;C0030054;C0006104;C0025260;C0458827;C0025260;C0025260;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C0947630;C0947630;C0037313;C0947630;C0037313;C0947630;C1527305;C0037313;C0947630;C0037313;C0037313;C0392366;C0392366;C0026516;C0026516;C0026516;C1527305;C0026516;C0684336;C1550655;C1550655;C0033213;C1457887;C0184511;C1518681;C3844714;C2347273;C0184511;C0184511;C0332155;C1444662,0,114,0,8,8,0.010962482,0.009975083,0,0,0.023077157

This can occur many times during~     sleep. It is known to cause sleepiness and poor concentration during the day. Research~     indicates that OSA may be a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease due to its~     association with hypertension, stroke, heart attack and sudden death. The standard therapy~     for symptomatic OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP has been shown to~     effectively reduce snoring, obstructive episodes and daytime sleepiness and to modestly~     reduce blood pressure and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

NCT00151177,Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation After Acute Ischemic Stroke,"~     More than half of all stroke patients have sleep apneas in the acute phase after stroke.~     Sleep apneas may be associated with higher degrees of disability three months after stroke~     due to numerous factors associated with sleep apneas such as persistent hypertension, cardiac~     arrhythmias, and clotting disorders.~      Non-invasive CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure)-therapy may reverse a number of these~     effects very shortly after initiation. The aim of the study is to test the feasibility of~     early non-invasive CPAP treatment starting in the first night after stroke onset, and to test~     its efficacy in a randomized clinical trial.~      50 patients with acute ischemic stroke will be enrolled and randomly assigned to standard~     care PLUS CPAP treatment or standard care only. All patients randomized to the intervention~     group will receive CPAP therapy for the first three nights after stroke. In the fourth night,~     a cardiorespiratory polygraphy will be performed in patients and controls. Patients assigned~     to the intervention group with a respiratory distress index > 10/h will be treated further~     on. On admission, day 4, and day 10 after stroke, diffusion weighted MRI imaging will be~     performed to determine the size of the infarction. The NIHSS score will be used to assess~     clinical short-term outcome on day 4 and day 10. After three months, the outcome will be~     determined using the modified Rankin scale.~      As CPAP therapy may be more laborious for the provider, the additional work-load will be~     documented using pre-specified scales.~      Primary hypothesis of the study is, that CPAP therapy is feasible in acute stroke patients~     and that the additional work load will not outweigh the benefits.~      Secondary hypothesis is that patients assigned to the treatment group have smaller~     infarctions on MRI and less neurological deficits at 3 months after stroke.~      Patients entering the study will be investigated by transcranial Doppler ultrasound in case~     they have sufficient temporal bone windows for insonation and no stenosis or occlusions of~     major brain supplying arteries by the time of investigation that disturb the intracerebral~     blood flow.~      All intracranial arteries will be assessed before treatment, after treatment and on day 8~     after the insult.~      Screen shots will be taken and will be analysed by dynamic vascular ultrasound (DVA), a new~     software algorithm developed by NHSi, to investigate microcirculatory information from the~     flow spectra of the major intracranial arteries.~      The data from this post-hoc analysis are compared with the data of the polysomnography and~     with treatment.~      Primary hypothesis in this substudy is that DVA reliably identifies patients with sleep apnea~     on days one and four after stroke.

NCT03857802,Efficiency of a Nursing Intervention in Sleep Hygiene,"~     Background: The relationship between the appearance of insulin resistance phenomena and~     insufficient or poor-quality sleep is scientifically documented.~      Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of an intervention based on behavioural techniques~     on sleep in the nursing consultation in the Primary Care setting to improve the level of~     HbA1c in patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 2 (DM2) or prediabetes.~      Hypothesis: Patients diagnosed with DM2 or prediabetes with poor sleep quality would improve~     their HbA1c levels after an intervention on healthier sleep hygiene practices. Sleeping 6 or~     less hours in adults diagnosed with DM2 or prediabetes would be related to worse metabolic~     control results. Patients diagnosed with DM2 or prediabetes who would value their sleep as~     poor quality would have poorer metabolic control.~      Methodology: Design: Not masked randomized clinical trial. Target population: Patients~     diagnosed up to the time of DM2 (E11) or prediabetes (R73, R73.9) with age over 18 attending~     the chronic nurses' follow-up visits of the Basic Health Area of Balaguer in the time range~     from November 2017 to December 2018.

NCT03011762,Feasibility and Predictive Accuracy of an In-Home Computer Controlled Mandibular Positioner in Identifying Favorable Candidates for Oral Appliance Therapy,"~     Sleep apnea is a condition in which the throat air passage closes during sleep and repeatedly~     interrupts breathing. The standard treatment of sleep apnea is air pressure applied to the~     nose, so-called nasal CPAP, but it is not suitable for all patients. Another treatment is to~     use a dental appliance while asleep. In this treatment, an appliance covers the upper and~     lower teeth and acts to pull the jaw forward, which opens the throat passage. This allows the~     patient to breathe normally.~      Dental appliance treatment does not work effectively in all patients. In order to identify~     those in whom dental appliance therapy will be effective, the study sponsor has invented the~     remotely controlled mandibular positioner, MATRx. The MATRx is an FDA cleared motorized~     dental appliance which is used overnight in hospital sleep studies and works by pulling the~     jaw outward under the control of a technician.~      In order to eliminate the need for an overnight in hospital sleep study, the sponsor has~     invented a new device that allows for the identification of individuals who are suitable~     candidates for dental appliance therapy from the comfort of the home. Like with MATRx,~     participants will sleep with a motorized mandibular positioner in place. But, it is~     controlled by a computer, rather than a sleep technician, making it a computer controlled~     mandibular positioner (CCMP). The feasibility and predictive accuracy of multi night testing~     using the CCMP will be evaluated through participation in this study.~      The sponsor has carried out two previous research trials leading to the development of the~     CCMP. The first established the predictive accuracy of the remotely controlled mandibular~     positioner at identifying candidates suitable for oral appliance therapy and their effective~     therapeutic setting. The second established the accuracy of the algorithms used by the CCMP~     to similarly identify successful candidates in a clinical setting. No significant problems~     were identified in conjunction with our previous research protocol, and no significant risks~     were identified. This third protocol is to establish the feasibility and accuracy of the CCMP~     when used in the home setting.~      The trial will utilize data collected over a series of nights to formulate a prediction of~     therapeutic outcome with an oral appliance. The prediction will be tested by comparing the~     degree of airway obstruction without treatment (from data collected prior to the study) to~     the degree of airway obstruction with oral appliance therapy. A custom fit oral appliance~     will be provided to participants as part of the trial.~      The purpose of the study is to test the predictive accuracy of the CCMP in identifying~     favorable candidates for oral appliance therapy and in determining an efficacious protrusive~     position. Another purpose is to evaluate the convenience and possibility of carrying out a~     multi-night CCMP study in the home.~      There are no known risks or side effects to the CCMP studies, to the home studies, or to the~     oral appliance therapy. It is possible that participants will have some discomfort during the~     nights of the CCMP studies but this will be transient and not cause any long term damage.~     Participants may experience soreness of the teeth or jaw joint during adjustment of the oral~     appliance by the dentist. There is no risk of jaw dislocation or problems with the~     temporomandibular joint (TMJ).~      Participants will have the benefit of receiving a dental appliance for treating their sleep~     apnea at no charge. This will be supplied to participants by a dentist who is an expert in~     this field. Participation in the study will also allow the further development and ultimately~     commercialization of the CCMP device which may help individuals who have sleep apnea.~      Dental appliance therapy is just one of two therapies for sleep apnea. If participants choose~     not to have the dental appliance therapy, they may wish to try nasal continuous positive~     airway pressure. Participants may withdraw at any time during the study without compromising~     their health care in any way. To withdraw, participants should simply notify one of the~     physicians or the research assistant. If the sponsor obtains new information that might~     affect an individual's willingness to participate in the study, they will be informed~     immediately.~   ",C0180112,C0428719;C0020792;C4019276;C4019276;C0037315;C0037315;C0028778;C0028778;C0037315;C0596545;C0332149;C2584320;C1331418;C3665375;C0424522;C3665375;C0037313;C0040426;C0037313;C0037313;C0037313;C0037313;C0040426;C0003578;C0037313;C0028429;C3536832;C3536832;C0022359;C0022359;C0022359;C0022359;C0012691;C0002045;C1446409;C0424092;C0424092;C0033213;C0600091;C0600091;C1269048;C3810854;C0037313;C0033213;C0180112;C0180112;C0180112;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495,0,0,-1,4,4,0.002226792,0.008673444,0,0,0.02022017

NCT00607100,High-Resolution Optical Coherence Tomography for Detection of Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Loss in Band Atrophy of the Optic Nerve,"~     The purpose of this study is to compare the abilities of high-speed,high-resolution (HR)~     optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Stratus OCT for detection of retinal nerve fiber layer~     (RNFL) loss in eyes with band atrophy (BA) of the optic nerve.~   ",C0029130;C0040395;C1511790;C0225326;C0035298,C0040395;C1511790;C0225326;C0029130;C0035298,0,0,-1,21,21,0.003289295,0.002537148,0,0,0.018676723
NCT02554487,Early Sleep Apnea Treatment in Stroke,"~     Investigating the interrelation of stroke and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is of major~     importance. First because of the high occurrence rate of stroke and the fact that it is a~     frequent cause of long-term disability in adulthood. Second because SDB (obstructive, central~     and mixed forms) affects more than 50% of stroke survivors and has a detrimental effect on~     clinical stroke outcome. Third, spontaneous and learning-dependent sleep-associated~     neuroplasticity may be affected by SDB following stroke worsening stroke rehabilitation.~     Therefore, it is crucial to investigate whether early treatment of SDB with Adaptive~     Servo-Ventilation (ASV), the treatment device of choice to treat obstructive, central and~     mixed forms of SDB, has a beneficial effect on the evolution of the lesion volume and on~     clinical stroke outcome.~      To this end, the investigators recruit and prospectively follow 3 groups of patients with~     ischemic stroke over 1 year. During the first night after hospital admission due to acute~     stroke, nocturnal breathing is assessed by means of a respiratory polygraphy. Patients with~     significant sleep disordered breathing, defined as an Apnea-Hypopnea-Index (AHI) > 20/h, are~     randomized to ASV treatment or no treatment (sSDB ASV+ or sSDB ASV-). ASV treatment starts~     the second night following hospital admission and ends 90 days later. Stroke patients without~     SDB (AHI < 5 / h) serve as a control group (no SDB) to observe the evolution of the lesion~     volume and stroke outcome without the additional burden of SDB.~      Lesion volume one day after hospital admission due to acute stroke (after potential lysis~     therapy) measured by Diffusion Weighted Imaging will be subtracted from lesion volume~     measured by T2-weighted volumetry assessed 90(+/-7) days following stroke and compared~     between patients with and without ASV treatment (sSDB ASV+ and sSDB ASV-) as well as patients~     without SDB (no SDB). Short- and long-term clinical stroke outcomes are assessed by clinical~     scales and questionnaires 4 to 7 days, 3 months and 1 year following stroke. Cognitive~     outcome is assessed during hospitalization (within the first week following stroke) and after~     the treatment period of 90 days by neuropsychological tests assessing attention and memory.~     In addition, baseline assessment of physiological parameters such as blood pressure and~     endothelial function/arterial stiffness are assessed during the first weeks following stroke~     and at the end of the treatment period, i.e. approximately 90 days following stroke.~   ",C0037315;C0038454;C0376495,C0598801;C0184666;C0184666;C0184666;C0948008;C0019993;C0034394;C0005823;C0004268;C0427008;C0023185;C0235546;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0221198;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0221198;C0038454;C0221198;C0038454;C0038454;C0222045;C0038454;C0038454;C0037313;C0037313;C0037313;C0003578;C0918012;C2948499;C2948499;C0221198;C0038454;C0024348;C2598130;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495,0,0,-1,0,0,0.010555779,0.007974838,0,0,0.018556269
NCT01071421,Sleep Apnea Syndrome and Community Acquired Pneumonia,"The association of sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) with the infections of the lower      airway has not been studied. The aspiration of secretions of the upper airway and the      colonization by microorganisms is considered a main event in most of the cases of community      acquired pneumonia (CAP) , and specially in the nosocomial pneumonia. The silent aspiration      to the lower airway is a common phenomenon in normal subjects during the sleep and some      studies has reported that the patients with SAHS present an increase of the risk to      pharyngeal aspirations. In fact, the presence of nasal and bronchial inflammation in patients      with SAHS is a recognized event. The patients with SAHS could have a risk increased to      develop pneumonia due to predisposition to the pharyngeal microaspiration to lower airways      during the sleep and other mechanical factors associated. The prevalence of SAHS in patients      with CAP could be increased as regards the data published for the same Spanish population.      The presence of an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) could be a risk factor not only to to CAP but      to to present a unfavorable clinical evolution in comparison to patients with CAP with a      normal AHI. The aim of this study will establish a relation between SAHS and the pneumonia      risk.",C0037315;C0032285;C3245488,C0949083;C0012655;C0021368;C0004083;C0037315;C0004056;C0035648;C3714514;C0349707;C0036537;C0349707;C0031354;C0031354;C0032285;C0205039;C0032285;C0032285;C0235546;C0039082;C3245488;C0700287;C0392148;C0392148;C0235546;C0947630;C0150312;C0178987;C0150312;C0178987;C0178987;C0178987;C3245511;C1553386;C1553386;C0037313;C0028429;C0037313;C0003578;C0918012;C0947630;C3245479;C2948499;C0233492;C4289767;C2827713;C0236175;C1704324;C3272565;C2363670;C0151576,0,0,0,1,1,0.008715003,0.007873938,0,0,0.018441716
