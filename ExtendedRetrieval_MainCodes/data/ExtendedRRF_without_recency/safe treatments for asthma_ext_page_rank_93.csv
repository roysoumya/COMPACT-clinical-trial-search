NCT00497237,Clinical Trial of the Efficacy and Safety of Beclomethasone Dipropionate Plus Formoterol vs Fluticasone Propionate Plus Salmeterol in the 6 Months Step Down Treatment of Asthma,"Asthma is a serious global health problem. People of all ages in countries throughout the      world are affected by this chronic airway disorder that can be severe and sometimes fatal.      The prevalence of asthma is increasing everywhere, especially among children.According to      international guidelines, once control of asthma is achieved and maintained for at least 3      months, a gradual reduction of the maintenance therapy should be tried in order to identify      the minimum therapy required to maintain control. This will help reduce the risk of side      effects and enhance patient adherence to the treatment plan.      Reduction of therapy in patients on combination therapy should begin with a reduction in the      dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroid.1 The present study is designed to evaluate if patients      with controlled asthma treated with FP 1000 mcg + salmeterol 100 mcg daily can be stepped      down. Stepping-down will be attempted with two medications: a new combination of extrafine      beclomethasone dipropionate 400 mcg + formoterol 24 mcg daily (test medication, Foster?) and,      alternatively, fluticasone propionate 500 mcg + salmeterol 100 mcg daily(reference      medication) without losing asthma control.If this hypothesis will be confirmed, the present      study will demonstrate that asthma control can be maintained with less than half the dose of      inhaled corticosteroid and with less medical costs.      Given the aims of this study, the population to be monitored includes adult patients with      moderate persistent asthma, which can be defined controlled according to the current      guidelines under standard stabilised treatment. The intended treatment duration is therefore      designed to ensure that good control of asthma is firmly achieved before stepping down the      treatment (8 weeks run-in period), but also that the condition of the patients are followed      long enough (24 weeks comparative treatment period) to ensure that a new stable condition is      also obtained and properly monitored.",C0004906;C0117996;C1096775;C0060657;C0073992;C0087111;C0004096,C0004906;C0117996;C0677908;C0009429;C0599880;C0001617;C0013227;C0162791;C0073992;C0060657;C0013227;C0073992;C0013227;C0162791;C4551656;C1293152;C4551656;C0750484;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0012634;C0087111;C0012634;C0012634;C3245501;C2828392;C1551357;C0427149;C0033213;C0087111;C0087111;C0004048;C0150312;C0150312;C0004048;C0004096;C0178987;C0205082;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0025344;C0025344;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C1552861;C0392366;C1578513;C0600140;C1578513;C3539181;C1518681;C4684637;C2911690;C2911690;C3858576;C0332534;C1561542;C1706074;C1522411;C0931554;C0221106;C0030695;C0030695;C0220825;C0427149;C1547226;C0332155;C0546816;C4698129;C1304888,0,0,1,9,9,0.010629754,0.012824771,1,1,0.039464336

NCT01524198,The Use of Inhaled Corticosteroids in the Treatment of Asthma is Children in the Emergency Room,"Asthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood. About 10% of children are affected.      Not surprisingly, acute asthma exacerbations are one of the common reasons to visit pediatric      emergency rooms (ER). About 5.7% of all pediatric emergency room visits are due to acute      asthma exacerbation. Around 8% of those get admitted to the hospital. This constitutes huge      financial and administrative burden on the health care system.      Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is the gold standard prophylactic therapy for patients with      persistent asthma. In the setting of acute asthma exacerbation systemic steroids given early      in the course of treatment help decrease the rate of admission and return to the ER. However,      the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids, through which this effect is caused, takes 4      hours to start working. This is because it is mediated through genomic pathways where the      transcription of several inflammatory cytokines is suppressed. It was also shown that      corticosteroids can cause vasoconstriction through non-genomic pathways. The onset of this      action is as quick as 30-60 minutes. It is proposed that this action is mediated by blocking      the extraneuronal uptake (metabolism) of norepinephrine in vascular smooth muscle cells,      hence, making it available for re-use by the sympathetic neuronal cells.      Our objective is to compare the efficacy of adding repetitive sequential doses of budesonide      versus placebo (normal saline (NS)) to ?2-agonist and ipratropium bromide (IB) combination      (standard treatment) in the management of acute asthma in children in the ER. We hypothesize      that the addition of budesonide to ?2-agonist and IB in the management of moderate to severe      acute asthma in the ER is superior to the addition of placebo.",C0001617;C0087111;C1546844;C0004048;C0004096,C0349790;C0349790;C0349790;C0700580;C4684780;C0008679;C0001617;C0001617;C0001617;C0028351;C0445115;C0582415;C0582415;C0086388;C0025519;C0054201;C0376636;C0054201;C0376636;C1546399;C1546399;C1546457;C0087111;C0184666;C0018017;C0184666;C2828392;C0038317;C0005847;C0004048;C0087111;C0542559;C0032042;C0032042;C0004096;C3245511;C3245511;C0004096;C1518681;C0243144;C0205082;C1512346;C3244317;C1552850;C0018026;C1552861;C3539181;C0003209;C0442797;C3845829;C0009653;C0776963;C0442743;C1524094;C1512346;C0009813;C0127400;C0127400;C0233660;C1547226;C0886384;C0546816;C0220644;C0220644;C0220644,56,3624,0,4,4,0.011470353,0.01098631,0,1,0.032481605

NCT01074853,Beta Blockers for the Treatment of Asthma,"Current asthma medicines include inhalers. A common inhaler used in asthma is called a      beta-agonist (for example salbutamol). They improve asthma symptoms by stimulating areas in      the human airway resulting in widening of the human airway. Although these drugs are useful      after the first dose, longterm use can cause worsening asthma symptoms.      Beta-blockers are the complete opposite type of medication. Just now they are avoided in      patients with asthma as after the first dose they can cause airway narrowing and cause an      asthma attack.      New research has suggested that long term use of beta-blockers can reduce airway inflammation      which can improve asthma control and improve symptoms.      This research was done in asthmatic patients who didn't need inhaled steroids to control      their asthma.

NCT00562991,Monitoring Asthma Treatment Using Exhaled Nitric Oxide,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the airways develop increased      responsiveness to various stimuli such as exposure to an allergen, cold air or exercise. It      is characterized by airway hyper-responsiveness, inflammation, increased mucus production,      and airway obstruction. Since inflammation is an important feature of asthma, the use of      non-invasive tests to measure lung inflammation to monitor asthma are of interest.The purpose      of the study is to relate costs associated with healthcare utilization and loss of work and      school time to the primary health outcome of cumulative number of symptom-free days.

NCT01520051,Mepolizumab Treatment for Rhinovirus-induced Asthma Exacerbations,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by lower respiratory      tract (LRT) symptoms such as wheeze, cough and airway obstruction. Patients with asthma      frequently suffer from exacerbations, which can be triggered by allergens and, in particular,      viral respiratory infections. It has recently been shown that mepolizumab, a humanized      monoclonal antibody that neutralizes interleukin(IL)-5, markedly reduces the exacerbation      rate in asthma patients with eosinophilic airway inflammation. Previous studies have      indicated that in a mixed population (eosinophilic and non eosinophilic) of mild asthma      patients, mepolizumab did not have an impact on lung function and asthma symptom scores upon      allergen provocation, although it did on markers such as sputum and blood eosinophils.      Together, these observations led to the hypothesis that mepolizumab treatment reduces the      exacerbation rate by limiting virus-induced asthma exacerbations.      The investigators hypothesize that neutralization of IL-5 during virus infection in patients      with allergic asthma:        1. Reduces virus-induced bronchial inflammation        2. Attenuates virus-induced asthma symptoms, airflow limitation and bronchial           hyperresponsiveness.        3. Enhances cellular immune responses to the virus.      The aims of this study are to:        1. To investigate whether IL-5 neutralization reduces the inflammatory response to viral           airway infections in allergic asthma patients        2. To investigate whether IL-5 neutralization prevents or reduces asthma symptoms during           virus-induced asthma exacerbations        3. To investigate whether IL-5 neutralization affects the cellular immune response to viral           airway infections in allergic asthma patients",C0969324;C0276447;C0087111;C0004096;C4086268,C0035243;C1290884;C1155266;C0349790;C0349790;C0001883;C0042769;C0155877;C0155877;C0155877;C0035245;C0021368;C0700325;C0021368;C0969324;C0969324;C0969324;C0746619;C3714514;C3714514;C0087111;C0205039;C0205039;C0003241;C0178539;C0178539;C1704632;C0178987;C0947630;C1457887;C0231999;C0004096;C0043144;C0004096;C0683278;C0004096;C0178987;C0004096;C0004096;C0038056;C0004096;C0439662;C0178987;C0004096;C0439662;C0178987;C1185740;C0010200;C0005767;C0947630;C0042497;C1704632;C1578828;C1578828;C1578828;C1578828;C1457887;C1550655;C1457887;C1457887;C4086268;C0014457;C0014457;C0014457;C4086268;C0200638;C0005516;C0001721;C4086268;C0802014;C1512793;C1512793;C1512793;C3845941;C0032930;C3274161,0,0,1,1,1,0.010827125,0.010794508,0,0,0.02776889

NCT01544634,Beta Blocker Therapy in Mild to Moderate Asthmatics,"Current asthma medicines include inhalers. A common type of inhaler is called a      'beta-agonist' (e.g. salbutamol). They improve asthma symptoms by stimulating areas in the      airway causing it to widen. Although these drugs are useful short term, long term use can      make asthma worse in some people.      'Beta-blockers' are the complete opposite type of medication. Just now they are avoided in      patients with asthma. Beta-blockers cause problems in asthmatics in the short term, including      severe asthma attacks.      The other mainstay of inhaler treatment for asthma is inhaled steroid or 'preventer'      medication. These work by dampening down the inflammation in the lungs that occurs in asthma.      New research has suggested that longer term use of beta-blockers can also reduce airway      inflammation which may improve asthma control. This research was done in asthmatic patients      who didn't need inhaled steroids to control their asthma. At the moment the investigators are      studying to see if there is a benefit of beta-blocker use for asthma over and above      asthmatics own usual doses of inhaled steroids.      In this study, the investigators will be trying to find out if adding a beta blocker to a      smaller dose of steroid inhaler has the same effect on asthma control as just using a higher      dose of steroid inhaler by itself.",C0001645;C1547226;C0087111;C1547225;C0004096,C0347950;C0021368;C0021368;C0001645;C0001645;C0001927;C0013227;C0004096;C0013227;C0004096;C0087111;C0004096;C0021461;C0038317;C0038317;C0021461;C2987634;C0021461;C0004048;C0038317;C0004048;C0004048;C0038317;C0021461;C0038317;C0021461;C0004096;C3245511;C0004096;C0178987;C0004096;C0004096;C0205082;C0004096;C0004096;C0178987;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C1518681;C0004096;C0013227;C1457868;C0024109;C0947630;C0042789;C0001645;C1457887;C0033213;C0184511;C0184511;C0776963;C0001645;C0001645;C0013227;C4283785,0,0,1,6,3,0.010965483,0.012700078,0,0,0.02611496

NCT00995657,Dose Response of Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) to Inhaled Steroids in Mild-to-moderate Asthma,"~     Asthma is a chronic disease, which means that it cannot be cured, but the investigators can~     use inhalers and tablets to control the symptoms. In asthma, the airways become inflamed and~     irritated which can cause coughing and make the airways tighten. This 'inflammation' is the~     root of the problem in asthma. Doctors have different ways to measure the inflammation in the~     airways. One way is to measure a gas called nitric oxide (NO) on the breath. This is made by~     the lungs when asthmatic inflammation is present. The investigators have been using NO as a~     test in research labs for many years, but there are still unanswered questions about how it~     changes between morning and night and how quickly medicines work on it. In most asthmatics,~     even small doses of inhaled steroids (preventers) can reduce the NO levels to normal, but in~     some people this does not seem to happen. The investigators now have portable NO machines~     that are designed for patients to use in the home. The investigators want to follow NO~     readings in patients with high levels to measure how they respond to different doses of~     steroid inhalers. The investigators hope this will help the investigators better understand~     asthma inflammation and treatments.~   ",C0028128;C0004096,C0008679;C0021368;C0021368;C0028128;C0021368;C0021368;C1457887;C0010200;C0033213;C0150312;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0021461;C0021461;C2946261;C2946261,0,0,-1,14,7,0.011678347,0.00836198,0,0,0.022769642
