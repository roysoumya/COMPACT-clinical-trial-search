NCT02574065,Effects on Crying Time in Colicky Infants With the Supplementation of Lactobacillus Reuteri DSM 17938,"~     Infant colic is a common condition characterized by excessive crying. The otherwise healthy~     infant aged less than 3 months is difficult to console during the periods with crying. The~     condition is defined by modified Wessel's criteria i.e. crying for more than 3 hours of the~     day, for more than 3 days of the week for at least 1 week.~      The description of infant colic hasalso been defined by Rome III diagnostic criteria~     andincludes infants from birth to 4 months of age,without failure to thrive, that are showing~     paroxysms of irritability, fussing or crying that starts and stops without obvious cause. The~     episodes last 3 or more hours/day and occur at least 3days/week for at least one week. The~     infant has no signs of central nervous system or intrinsic developmental difficulties, is~     normal on physical examination, and has normal growth patterns.~      Although infant colic is considered to be self limiting it is a distressing problem for~     families. It is in fact one of the most common reasons why parents seek the advice of a~     paediatrician or family practitioner during their child's first 3 months of life Up to 20% of~     infants under three months are affected by infant colic.~      Infant colic could have significant adverse effects on family quality of life and could even~     be a trigger for shaken baby syndrome. Parental perception associated with colicky complaints~     is therefor strongly recommended to be an outcome measure in trials of infantile colic.~      Measurement of parental/family quality of life and parental perception of colic severity with~     the help of a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in a Polish study showed that the use of a~     probiotic, Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938, could improve the perceived problems.~      The relationship between infant colic and gastroenterological, allergical and psychological~     disorders later in childhood was studied in a prospective study on 96 infants divided into~     two groups, colicky and non-colicky. The children diagnosed with infant colic, showed an~     increased susceptibility to recurrent abdominal pain, allergic and psychological disorders in~     childhood when they were 10 years old.~      The aetiology of infantile colic seems to be multifactorialbut is,despite many years of~     research, still unknown. The intestinal microbiota differs between infants with and without~     colic and has therefore been suggested to have a potential role. Other possible explanations~     are for example gut motility disturbances, low-grade mucosal inflammation and visceral~     hypersensitivity.~      Evidence suggests thatadministration of the probioticL. reuteri DSM 17938 might offer some~     benefit.L. reuteri DSM 17938 has been tested for its effect on crying in colicky infants and~     has been demonstrated to have a significantly favourable effect on crying time in fivetrials.~     One is a randomized trial that compared the probioticto Simethicone; three areplacebo~     controlled randomized double blind trials and yet another is a placebo controlled randomized,~     single blind, observational study. A fifth studydid not find any effect.~      Combining the results in a meta-analysis from three double blind, placebo controlled~     randomized trials (published at the time of the analysis, including the neutral one) found~     that, compared with placebo, L. reuteri administration reduced crying time at day 21 with~     about 40 min.~      Recently it has been documented in a clinical trial that prophylactic use of L. reuteriDSM~     17938during the first three months of lifereduced the onset offunctional gastrointestinal~     disorders, particularly functional constipation, regurgitation and infantile colic.~      In conclusion, the administration L. reuteri DSM 17938 may reduce the crying time in children~     with infantile colic, especially those fed predominantly or exclusively with breast milk.~     However, further randomized controlled studies, are required to be able develop~     recommendations in the management of infant colic.~      The present trial is undertaken to further document the effect of L. reuteri DSM 17938 on~     crying in colicky infants.~   ",C1135167;C0242296,C0031809;C0686721;C0015544;C0879626;C0266836;C0266836;C0012655;C0578019;C2004489;C0021368;C0009806;C0678257;C0037138;C1301725;C0332149;C1510470;C0033213;C0150312;C0150600;C0006141;C0005615;C0030193;C0699819;C0266836;C0266836;C1301746;C0184511;C0032042;C0032042;C0032042;C0723338;C0596601;C0222045;C1135167;C3845829;C3845829;C0042779;C0577620;C0180112;C0180112;C0180112,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.002659118,0.008513014000000001,0,5,0.036201808202460675
NCT03148002,Peritoneal Dialysis Pilot Study: Evaluating Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) for Constipation,"~     Constipation is a common condition, which occurs one in four Canadians. Maintaining regular~     bowel movements is imperative because constipation can affect the quality of PD dialysate~     flow and result in an unwanted effect on the dialysis adequacy.~      There is limited data on how to best manage constipation in the peritoneal dialysis~     population. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is an osmotic laxative that is becoming popular for~     prevention and treatment of constipation across Canada. Although some PD programs in Canada~     have already converted to PEG for management of constipation, more research in this~     population would help guide practice. For now, the current PD bowel regimen at the Nova~     Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) includes daily preventative therapy using a stimulant~     laxative, senna, along with an osmotic laxative, lactulose, for acute constipation.~      The investigators will review all patients in the NSHA PD program who have regular or recent~     laxative use for participation in this study. Patients included in this study will be~     randomly assigned to the Current Bowel Protocol or the PEG Bowel Protocol for 8 weeks.~      The goal is to determine if the PEG Bowel Protocol is as effective and safe for the~     prevention of constipation as the Current Bowel Protocol used in the PD Program. The~     investigators will use bowel function diaries and patient surveys to determine efficacy and~     safety outcomes.~   ",C0031139;C0009806;C4282033;C0032483,C0353980;C0353980;C0009806;C0009806;C0009806;C0009806;C0009806;C0009806;C0442034;C2728259;C2728259;C0038951;C4282033;C4282033;C4282033;C4282033;C0032483;C0304402;C0026649;C0282090;C0282090;C0009806;C2728259;C3834249;C0376495,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.008788236999999999,0.006853545,0,2,0.035862079883483465
NCT01582659,Outpatient Treatment of Constipation in Children,"Constipation is a condition often seen in children. Constipation is often associated with      impaired quality of life of the child and of great concern among parents. Despite the fact      that both diagnosis and treatment is a simple task, it is often seen that the treatment      fails, and many children are referred to a pediatric ward for specialized treatment.      There is currently little research on the subject and treatment is therefore based on expert      knowledge rather than scientific research.      The study objective is to identify the most effective and least stressful treatment of      children with constipation for both families and the health care system.      The following will be tested:      Does treatment of constipation in children require specialized knowledge and extensive      resources or can the treatment be simplified?

NCT04263896,Bowel Function After Minimally Invasive Hysterectomy,"~     Postoperative constipation affects up to a third of women undergoing minimally invasive (MIS)~     gynecologic surgery and is a major source of anxiety and discomfort. The average time to~     first bowel movement after gynecologic surgery is about 2 to 4 days and some factors~     responsible for this include anesthesia inhibitory effect on gastrointestinal motility,~     opioid pain medication use, chronic NSAID use and anatomic manipulation.~      There are no established regimens to manage postoperative constipation after minimally~     invasive gynecologic surgery. Two studies evaluating the implementation of postoperative~     bowel regimen with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and with Senna and Docusate found no significant~     impact on postoperative bowel function. There have been no studies looking at the effect of~     preoperative bowel regimens on postoperative bowel function.~      The purpose of this study is to evaluate postoperative bowel function after minimally~     invasive hysterectomy in women receiving a preoperative 10-day bowel regimen of PEG daily.~   ",C0020699,C0009806;C0009806;C0020699;C4049933;C0026649;C1692318;C0003467;C0449416;C0030193;C4282033;C4282033;C0032483;C4284232;C0596601;C0242402;C1510470,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.010940918999999999,0.006817920999999999,0,2,0.033271908271908276

NCT01955213,Methylnaltrexone for Opioid Induced Constipation,"Methylnaltrexone for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in the setting of      palliative or hospice care, is significantly more effective than placebo (1). However, in      both the randomized and the open-label phase of the multi center trial showing this favorable      outcome, the drug produced rescue-free laxation in only about half of the patients (2). There      may be several reasons for this result, since constipation in palliative care patients often      has multiple simultaneously occurring causes.      Assuming that constipation of the non-responders is still opioid-induced, one of the possible      reasons for not responding to methylnaltrexone could be that central actions of opioids      contribute to constipation by reducing motility of the intestines through direct actions in      the spinal dorsal horn (2). However, as methylnaltrexone is a µ-receptor antagonist and not      all opioids are solely µ-receptor agonists another reason may well be that successful      laxation is determined by the receptor-profile of the specific opioid the patient is using.      Opioids do not only influence bowel functioning, but also immune system functioning and      angiogenesis. Methylnaltrexone possibly antagonizes these changes, therefore this study will      also investigate the influence of methylnaltrexone on immunologic and angiogenic parameters.",C0066411;C0009806;C0242402,C0011135;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0030231;C0009806;C0085555;C0009806;C0009806;C0009806;C1519670;C0228575;C0021853;C0087111;C0332149;C0678835;C0243192;C1552740;C0542559;C0032042;C0242402;C0242402;C0242402;C0242402;C0242402;C3244286;C0242402;C0439662;C1705425;C0947630;C0013227;C3653430;C4082977;C1172713;C0700651;C0606665;C0404831;C0018792;C1328018;C1521740;C0332149;C0040597;C0040597,0,0,0,1,0.5,0.011549529,0.011264376000000001,0,1,0.03291370095493806
