NCT02980744,A Home-based Intervention to Reduce Sedentary Behaviour and Improve Function After Stroke,"The traditional approach to physical activity promotion in people with stroke has always      emphasized activities of a moderate-to-vigorous intensity (i.e. moving enough to breathe fast      and break a sweat). For many people with stroke who often have difficulty with walking,      achieving that intensity of activity is difficult. The result is that people with stroke      spend over 80% of their day in sedentary behaviours (too much sitting). A growing body of      research shows that too much sitting has negative effects on health including larger waist      circumference, unhealthy levels of blood glucose and insulin, heart disease, lower levels of      functioning, and premature death.      This project tests a new approach to activity promotion that focuses on increasing      light-intensity activity throughout the whole day while reducing sitting time. The new      intervention is titled ""STand Up Frequently From Stroke (STUFFS)"" and is aimed at increasing      self-confidence among people with stroke to sit less, stand up and walk around at frequent      intervals during the day. Studies in the general population have shown that standing up and      walking around frequently are beneficially associated with health indicators (lower waist      circumference, lower blood fat and glucose levels). Encouraging people with stroke to reduce      sitting and increase light-intensity activities appears feasible and sustainable and might be      a first step to increase their daily energy expenditure.",C0184661;C1705273;C0038454;C1548341;C1532253;C0184511,C0014272;C0237529;C0428548;C0392201;C0018799;C0184661;C1299586;C0677505;C0021212;C0332218;C0205160;C0277814;C0277814;C0021641;C0277814;C0277814;C0038454;C0560560;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038984;C0230097;C0011065;C0392366;C0596013;C0230097;C0005767;C1561538;C1578513;C1561538;C1578513;C0728713;C1561538;C0015677;C1518681;C0178520;C0151526;C4300452;C0275586;C0275586;C0221106;C0221106;C1547226;C4086497;C4049938;C3843660;C3843660;C4049938;C4049938;C0429028,0,0,0,0,0,0.002163871,0.0016732,0,3,0.037678327

NCT02537652,Central and Peripheral Blood Pressure in Stroke,"Individuals who experience a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) are at heightened      risk of subsequent vascular events, including heart attacks and secondary stroke/TIA. Blood      pressure control is considered the most important contributor to positive health outcomes in      stroke patients. The measurement of central blood pressure (cSBP) (the blood pressure which      is being exerted at the heart), may provide clinicians with important diagnostic and      prognostic information over and above that typically obtained from a peripheral blood      pressure measure (the blood pressure in the arm). Central blood pressures may be better than      traditional peripheral blood pressure measures as: i) peripheral blood pressure may not      accurately reflect the effects of peak arterial blood pressure on centrally located organs,      ii) central blood pressures may be 50 % superior to peripheral blood pressures when      predicting cardiovascular events, and iii) information pertaining to central blood pressures      may be more effective in the management of hypertension. While the validity of oscillometric      devices which measure central blood pressures has been demonstrated, further study is      required to determine precision under normal clinical operating conditions (i.e., reflective      of the Hospital/GP practice setting). As such, this study will assess central and peripheral      blood pressures of stroke patients when fasted and nonfasted, and when seated and supine. The      study is interested in identifying the effect of the above parameters (fasted vs. unfasted,      seated vs. supine) on central and peripheral blood pressures in stroke patients.      Participants will take part in three separate assessment sessions, on three separate days,      with a minimum 24 hour recovery between each session. Each assessment is expected to last 90      minutes, with a minimum of eight blood pressures being taken from the left upper arm. As      such, participants will be asked to give up 4.5 hours of their time to the study. During each      assessment participants will be tested in a fasted and non-fasted state, and in a supine      (lying) and seated position. All assessments will take place between 7 and 10am and will be      undertaken following written informed consent.",C0229664;C0460139;C0038454;C1879652,C0007787;C1272641;C1320716;C0229664;C0229664;C0229664;C0229664;C0229664;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0230347;C0027051;C0020538;C0015663;C1261322;C0237607;C0220901;C0376636;C0543488;C0031809;C0031809;C0031809;C0027627;C0460139;C0460139;C0005847;C0460139;C1446409;C0460139;C0460139;C0460139;C3245501;C0237607;C0015264;C0558058;C0542559;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0178784;C1553386;C0038454;C1518681;C0038454;C0392366;C0005767;C0018787;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0446516;C1550470;C0012634;C0086972;C0086972;C2004454;C1555587;C0009797;C3242430;C3242430;C1518681;C0011900;C1881145;C0029375;C0202165;C4084912;C4084912;C0233697;C4055646;C0231519;C4699372;C4697740;C3272565;C1879652;C0233697;C0886384;C4082977,0,0,0,1,1,0.002024784,0.002609894,0,4,0.02843175

When a person with OSA tries      to sleep the back of the throat closes and blocks the flow of air into lungs.When this      happens, a person's sleep is disrupted, causing minor awakenings(which the individual may not      recognize). This occurs many times throughout the night, causing poor sleep quality,excessive      daytime sleepiness, poor concentration, and sometimes depression.It is possible that poor      outcomes observed in stroke patients with OSA result from these neurocognitive phenomena,      presumably by reducing effective participation in rehabilitation activities.OSA is treated      with nasal continuous positive airway pressure(CPAP).CPAP therapy keeps the back of the      throat open so that airflow is never blocked.The study is designed to investigate whether      treatment of OSA with CPAP improves the results of rehabilitation.",C0199451;C0520679;C0038454;C1550655;C1705273,C1260922;C0541854;C0233417;C0518895;C0034991;C0034991;C0424563;C0011570;C0087111;C0332149;C1446409;C0087111;C0231999;C0028778;C0031354;C0028778;C0038454;C0178987;C0031354;C0037313;C0037313;C0037313;C0024109;C0037313;C0028429;C0947630;C0004600;C0004600;C1444662;C0184511;C0332155,0,0,1,38,38,0.002317528,0.002308707,1,5,0.026131759

NCT02399540,Late LTP-like Plasticity Effects of tDCS in Chronic Stroke Patients,"Rationale: About 80% of stroke patients suffer motor impairments, but current therapies have      limited effects on motor recovery. Therefore, investigating new potential therapeutic      approaches is crucial. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of      non-invasive electrical stimulation where a weak current is applied through electrodes over      the scalp. This stimulation is known to (1) induce changes in neuronal excitability -which      can last up to one day with late LTP-like plasticity protocols- in a polarity and      site-specific manner, and (2) facilitate motor learning and stroke recovery. However, it is      unknown how the motor cortex excitability changes that follow tDCS relate to the increase in      motor learning and recovery potential. The currently upheld hypothesis is that motor learning      needs to be synchronized in time with electrical stimulation (paired stimulation), but recent      results from our lab suggest that tDCS also increases skill learning after stimulation has      ended (unpaired stimulation). If this is true, tDCS has a much larger therapeutic window and      is a more valuable clinical tool than currently believed. Therefore, the investigators want      to investigate how late LTP-like plasticity tDCS affects the increase in skill learning      normally seen with tDCS when applied 24 hours before training. The outcome of this study can      provide important guidelines on effective motor therapy during stroke rehabilitation.      Objective: Identify the effect of late LTP-like plasticity tDCS in chronic stroke patients on      skill learning 24 hours later.      Study design: Double-blinded, randomized between-subjects trials. Study population: Chronic      stroke patients. Main study parameters/endpoints: The main objective of the study is to      determine the effect of late LTP-like plasticity tDCS on skill learning 24 hours later. As a      motor learning paradigm, the investigators will use a circuit tracking task which chronic      stroke patients perform better if tDCS is applied concurrently. During this task, patients      have to trace a cursor over a circuit as fast and accurately as possible by moving a computer      mouse.

NCT03395717,Stroke Rehabilitation With Exoskeleton-assisted Gait.,"~     Gait recovery is one of the main goals of post-stroke rehabilitation where robotic-assisted~     practice has shown positive outcomes. However, literature lacks of clinical studies on~     exoskeleton-supported gait rehabilitation. Recently, a wearable exoskeleton (Ekso?,~     EksoBionics, USA) has been commercialized for re-enabling patients to stand and walk,~     involving them directly in steps trigger through body weight balance. The main aim of this~     study is to assess the clinical and neuromuscular effects of exoskeleton-based gait~     rehabilitation in sub-acute and chronic stroke patients, compared to patients with similar~     characteristics who will conduct a traditional over-ground gait training.~      In this multicentric RCT, 162 stroke patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned to the~     Experimental Group (EG) or to the Control Group (CG). Patients will conduct at least 12~     one-hour-sessions (about 3 times/ week) of Ekso? (EG) or traditional over-ground (CG) gait~     rehabilitation. Clinical evaluations (lower limb Modified Ashworth Scale- MAS; Motricity~     Index - MI; Trunk Control Test - TCT; Functional Ambulation Classification - FAC; 10-meter~     walking test - 10mwt; 6-minute walking test - 6mwt; Walking Handicap Scale - WHS; Time Up and~     Go - TUG) will be administered to patients at the beginning (T1) and at the end (T2) of the~     training period. The primary outcome is the distance performed during the 6mwt.

NCT01706094,Head Position in Stroke Trial,"A simplest manner to augment cerebral blood flow to irrigate the ischemic penumbra in acute      ischemic stroke could be to place the patient in a 'lying flat' rather than upright head      position. Given uncertainty over the balance of potential modest benefits and risks, and      variability regarding the ideal head position policy for patients with acute ischemic stroke      around the world, reliable randomized evidence is required to standardize clinical practice.      The main objectives of this pilot phase clinical trial are to determine the feasibility,      safety and potential efficacy of a large-scale cluster randomized clinical trial to assess      whether a simple nursing care policy - 'lying flat head position' - provides beneficial      effects as compared to the standard upright head position in patients with acute ischemic      stroke. The main efficacy outcome of the pilot phase is demonstration of increased mean      cerebral blood flow velocity in the flat down compared to the upright head position, as      assessed by transcranial Doppler to the medial cerebral arteries of patients with anterior      circulation infarction. Secondary efficacy objectives are to demonstrate that the flat down      head position improves neurological status at 7 days and disability at 90 days.",C2347268;C0038454;C0018670,C0206034;C0373440;C0373440;C0746866;C0007770;C0948008;C0948008;C1096775;C0028678;C0087130;C0005775;C0018017;C0021308;C0018017;C0231170;C3858758;C3245501;C0237607;C2828392;C0014653;C0554756;C0242456;C0242456;C0038454;C0175659;C0018670;C0018670;C0018670;C0018670;C0018670;C0018670;C1518681;C3842337;C0723323;C4699589;C4699589;C0027627;C0231519;C0231519;C0231519;C0231519;C0231519;C0231519;C0022116;C3272565;C1555587;C0022116;C0751437;C0184511;C0591132;C0332535;C4082977;C0151576,0,0,0,1,0.333333333,0.002289172,0.002093777,0,3,0.024685194
NCT01573585,Fast Muscle Activation and Stepping Training (FAST) Post-stroke,The purpose of this study is to determine whether FAST (Fast muscle Activation and Stepping      Training) exercises will improve walking balance in individuals after stroke to a greater      extent than usual care.

NCT01882556,Early Use of Botulinum Toxin in Spasticity Post Stroke.,"Patients who survive a stroke are often left with an arm that cannot be used. One reason for      this is that the muscles affected by the stroke become overactive. This is known as      spasticity. Such unwanted muscle overactivity, if left untreated or poorly managed, can lead      to limb deformities. For example, the wrist and fingers in the arm affected by spasticity      become stiff and curl into a fist and the hand cannot be used for any functional purpose.      Palm hygiene can become difficult and patients find this deformity unsightly and painful.      Botulinum toxin (BT) has been shown to reduce muscle overactivity and is licensed for this      purpose. In current practice this treatment is often used as a last line of defence. Although      BT can reduce the muscle overactivity, when injected using current protocols, it seems to      have little impact on the recovery of function and/or treating the limb deformities and pain.      If BT can be given in the early stages of a stroke, i.e. as soon as the muscle overactivity      is observed, then we will be able to treat spasticity and may prevent the limb deformities      and pain from developing. We may also be able to assist the recovery of arm movement in some      of the patients who would otherwise not have regained this. In addition to benefiting the      patient, the prevention of secondary complications by early treatment may reduce the costs of      long term care to the NHS . We hope to discover if our plan of providing early treatment with      BT is more effective than the current approach. If we demonstrate that the treatment is      effective we will be able to introduce this new method almost immediately within the NHS      through our collaboration with doctors and therapists who are actively treating patients with      this condition.",C0006055;C0026838;C0038454,C0599766;C0006055;C0023977;C0009566;C0474395;C0474395;C0474395;C0474395;C0026838;C0026838;C0026838;C0199176;C0332155;C0332218;C0087111;C0442711;C0027627;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0012634;C0237607;C0310255;C0016129;C0030193;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0557034;C0025663;C0043262;C3244317;C1273517;C1442948;C0015385;C0018563;C1273517;C0230373;C1273517;C0015385;C0030193;C1299581;C0015385;C0030193;C1299581;C0392347;C1299581;C0446516;C0446516;C0446516;C1578513;C0456642;C1550655;C2004454;C0730881;C1697779;C0031843;C0699530;C1300072;C1548573;C0026649;C0181622,0,0,0,2,2,0.002413336,0.002369322,0,1,0.02411335

NCT03177161,"Assessment of Patient Reported Health Status Questions Via Four Different Methods of Administration, in Stroke Survivors.","A Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) is a questionnaire that asks patients for their      views on their own health or the impact of healthcare they have received on their health and      quality of life (RCN, 2011). The benefit of PROMS is that they gather information from the      patient's perspective, which offers great potential to improve the quality and outcomes of      health services (Department of Health 2011).      There is a PROM (the PROMIS-10 Global Health) and a number of extra questions that are      recommended for use in people who have had a stroke by the International Consortium for      Health Outcomes Measurement, but the best way of delivering these questions for stroke      survivors is unknown.      At present, the NHS in England, Scotland and Wales are required to offer every stroke      survivors a 6 month post stroke follow-up appointment. Currently, the information collected      at the 6 month review is not from the patient's perspective and the best method of collecting      this information has not been established. The Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme      (SSNAP) which is led by the Royal College of Physicians in London promote the 6 month      follow-up assessment. SSNAP recognise that currently 4 different methods of 6 month follow-up      appointment occur. The current methods in use are face-to-face assessment, telephone      interview, online questionnaire or postal questionnaire.      The aim of this research is to understand if there is a difference between these 4 methods of      delivering these questions in people who have had a stroke.      As part of the 6 month review this research study will assess the response rate for 15      Patient Reported Health Status questions across the 4 recognised methods of delivery;        -  Face-to-Face        -  Telephone        -  Online        -  Post      To conduct this research study a sample of 808 stroke survivors will be asked to take part in      the research. From these 808 people, 202 participants will be randomly assigned to each      method of administration (Face-to-Face Interview, Telephone Interview, Postal Questionnaire      and Online Questionnaire).

NCT01617343,The HEP-OKS Study - Hemifield Eye Patching and Optokinetic Stimulation to Treat Hemispatial Neglect in Stroke Patients,Spatial neglect represents one of the major cognitive disorders following stroke. Patients      patients fail to be aware of objects or people to their left and orientate instead to their      right side. Enduring neglect has been found to be a poor prognostic indicator for functional      independence following stroke. Despite some promising experimental accounts there are no      established treatments for this condition.      The aim of this study is to test whether a combined treatment with hemifield eye patching      (HEP) and optokinetic stimulation (OKS) can permanently reduce neglect behaviour and improve      functional outcome in patients with hemispatial neglect following stroke.      The investigators hypothesise that the treatment with HEP and OKS will lead to a greater      reduction of neglect scoring in the neglect test battery as well as a greater improvement in      functional independence scores as compared to the spontaneous clinical course of the      usual-care control group.,C0751421;C0441615;C0038454;C0947630;C0015392;C1550655;C1292856,C0009241;C0751421;C0009429;C0776981;C1292856;C0220901;C0087111;C0021212;C0012634;C0087111;C4551656;C0521874;C0521874;C0521874;C0521874;C0521874;C0542351;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C0392366;C1442948;C0392366;C0439857;C0439857;C0424013;C0677505;C4554468;C1550655;C0184511;C3844714;C0031843;C0031843;C0031843;C0015726;C1552839,0,0,1,3,3,0.002279215,0.002511886,0,2,0.023607294

NCT00989716,The Efficacy of Nitric Oxide in Stroke (ENOS) Trial,"Nitric oxide is a multimodal candidate treatment for acute stroke having a number of      properties which may be beneficial in acute stroke, including lowering blood pressure,      causing cerebral vasodilation, and improving central and systemic haemodynamics. Nitric oxide      donors are effective in experimental stroke and pilot studies in patients suggest that one,      glyceryl trinitrate, can be delivered easily in a transdermal preparation. Around half of all      patients admitted with acute stroke are taking antihypertensive therapy immediately prior to      their stroke. No data exist as to whether it is beneficial or safe to stop or continue this      treatment during the acute phase. ENOS is a prospective, international, multicentre,      randomised, parallel-group, blinded, controlled, collaborative, factorial trial designed to      test two questions related to the management of blood pressure immediately post-stroke:        1. The safety and efficacy of nitric oxide, given as transdermal glyceryl trinitrate.        2. The safety and efficacy of stopping or continuing prior antihypertensive medication.      Previously independent adult patients who are conscious and have residual limb weakness are      eligible for enrollment. Central randomisation will be performed via the internet. Treatment      is initiated within 48 hours of stroke onset and is given as daily glyceryl trinitrate      patches for 7 days. A computed tomography (CT) scan is required within 7 days of      randomisation. Early follow-up is performed locally over the 7 days of treatment, including      blood pressure, early stroke events, and adverse events. Telephone central follow-up by the      trial co-ordinating centre will be performed at 3 months. The primary outcome is combined      death or dependency (modified Rankin Score >2).",C0028128;C0038454,C1445777;C0585941;C0017887;C0017887;C0040405;C0003364;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0877248;C0587246;C0028128;C0751956;C0751956;C0595862;C0028128;C0751956;C0028128;C1290940;C0376636;C0013227;C1516879;C0011546;C0087111;C0087111;C0234421;C0087111;C0087111;C1515258;C0006104;C0184666;C0723457;C3245501;C0947630;C0038454;C0332219;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C3244317;C3244317;C0011065;C4050231;C3245479;C0392366;C0441633;C1820370;C0071888;C0427184;C0233492;C0699794;C1697779;C1697779;C2911690;C4281788;C1561542;C4331837;C1552839;C0018792;C4331837;C0018792;C0308779;C4554418;C1879652,0,0,0,13,6.5,0.003019319,0.002307622,0,4,0.022247172

NCT00085657,Brain Electrical Stimulation to Enhance Recovery After Stroke,"This study will examine whether brain stimulation using transcranial direct current      stimulation (tDCS) in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation therapy can help patients      recover strength and motor function more than rehabilitation therapy alone. For tDCS, two      small metal disks (electrodes) attached to wires are placed on small cotton pads and taped to      the subject's head, one on the forehead above the eye and the other on the top of the head.      The electrodes deliver a brief electrical current that stimulates the cortex, the part of the      brain responsible for motor function.      Adult patients who have weakness on one side of their body as a result of a stroke occurred      within the last 15 days may be eligible for this study. NIH is not directly recruiting      patients for this study. Patients will be selected through the National Rehabilitation      Hospital (NRH) Research Center personnel in Washington, DC, from patients under treatment at      that facilitiy. Candidates are screened with a physical and neurologic examination, a review      of tests done on admission to NRH, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, if one has      not been done since the stroke. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain      images of the brain. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic      field. During the MRI, the patient lies on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder.      Scanning time for this study takes about 30 to 45 minutes.      Participants are randomly assigned to receive tDCS or placebo stimulation, along with      rehabilitation therapy, for 2 to 3 weeks, depending on the patient's length of stay at the      NRH. For the placebo stimulation, electrodes are placed on the patient's scalp as with tDCS,      but no current is delivered. Before and after each rehabilitation session with electrodes,      patients undergo Jebsen Taylor motor testing, in which they are asked to lift small objects,      turn cards, use a spoon, stack checkers, and lift cans as fast as they can.      On the day of discharge, patients have physical and neurological examinations and the motor      function tests described below. The motor tests are repeated, along with standard care and a      review of their health status, during outpatient follow-up visits scheduled at 3, and 12      months. The motor tests are:        -  Wolf motor function test - Patients are asked to raise a forearm on a table, on a box,           to reach across a table, push a sandbag, place a hand on the table, pull a weight, lift           a can, pick up a pencil, pick up a paper clip, stack checkers, flip cards, use a key,           fold a towel, and pick up a basket.        -  Barthel index - Patients are timed for the speed with which they perform certain tasks,           such as feeding, grooming, or moving a wheelchair.        -  Abilhand questionnaire - Patients answer questions about how they perform routine daily           activities.        -  GOT test of tactile discrimination - Patients describe objects they feel with their           hand.        -  Ashworth spasticity scale - A medical staff person moves the patient's arm back and           forth to see how stiff it is.",C0013786;C2004454;C0038454;C0006104,C0024485;C0027853;C0034991;C0034991;C0027853;C0034991;C0870227;C0508431;C0230003;C0034991;C0034991;C0012632;C0430740;C0034394;C1292856;C1273518;C1292856;C1292856;C0430740;C0430740;C0043143;C0026838;C0087111;C0184666;C0012621;C0031843;C0016540;C0031843;C3714552;C0034606;C1552601;C0031843;C2828392;C0031843;C0518461;C2004454;C0308779;C0183115;C0032042;C0032042;C0016536;C0204695;C3244286;C0038454;C0595905;C0038454;C3810851;C0282443;C0038454;C0282443;C1305866;C0560560;C0947630;C0439044;C0006104;C0947630;C0947630;C0392366;C1553496;C0034546;C0006104;C1553496;C1706074;C0947630;C0036270;C0392366;C1706074;C1706074;C1706074;C0918012;C0002658;C0175659;C1551040;C0578671;C3850024;C1552861;C3850024;C0182158;C0018670;C0441633;C3850024;C3850024;C0181620;C0541749;C0181620;C0392366;C0018563;C0580846;C0181620;C0175722;C0392366;C1527305;C0018563;C0004600;C0015392;C1561538;C0446516;C0042789;C0589121;C0886384;C0086960;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0000589;C0683314;C1696103;C1561542;C0655359;C0308779;C0031809;C0181797;C0181797;C0031809;C0233697;C0087130,0,0,0,18,18,0.002290471,0.003057119,0,2,0.021466195

NCT01568957,Training Dual-Task Walking After Stroke,"Community ambulation is a highly complex skill requiring the ability to adapt to increased      environmental complexity and perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Deficits in dual-tasking      may severely compromise the ability to participate fully in community living. Unfortunately,      current rehabilitation practice for stroke fails to adequately address dual-task limitations;      individuals with stroke continue to exhibit clinically significant dual-task costs on gait at      discharge. As a result, many stroke survivors are living in the community with residual      deficits that may increase disability in the real world and lead to falls with devastating      consequences. To address this issue, the proposed study investigates the efficacy of      dual-task gait training on attention allocation and locomotor performance in      community-dwelling stroke survivors. Because walking in the real world often requires      time-critical tasks and obstacle avoidance, the investigators will test the impact of      dual-task gait training on cognitive-motor interference during walking at preferred speed and      at maximal speed (Aim 1), and on locomotor control during obstacle negotiation (Aim 2). The      investigators will also evaluate the effects of the intervention on community reintegration      and participation (Aim 3).",C1554161;C4283795;C0038454;C1554184,C0034991;C0085673;C0085673;C0184661;C0945826;C2945640;C0231170;C0012621;C0004268;C0870186;C0205082;C0237607;C1442065;C0015272;C1442065;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0085639;C0947630;C0002658;C0002658;C0016928;C1442948;C0392366;C2948600;C2948600;C2948600;C1518681;C0870921;C1555588;C3694424;C1547928;C3245501;C1547298;C0220825;C0939261;C0056170;C0151576,0,0,0,6,6,0.002193093,0.002373845,0,5,0.020470805
NCT01954212,Stroke Oral healthCare pLan Evaluation,"Stroke associated pneumonia (SAP) affects a fifth of stroke survivors annually, tripling the      risk of death at 30 days and contributing to poorer rehabilitation outcomes, prolonged      hospital stays and dependency at discharge. Systematic review evidence indicates that      enhanced oral health care (OHC) has a preventative effect on the incidence of pneumonia      amongst nursing home populations (absolute risk reductions 6.6% to 11.7%; numbers needed to      treat 8.6 to 15.3 individuals). There are strong theoretical reasons to suggest similar      benefits might be observed in stroke care settings but current empirical evidence is weak -      trial quality (randomisation, blinding, sample size, reporting), intervention description and      thus feasibility of translation into clinical practice is very poor. Following an extensive      pre-clinical programme of work, investigators now plan the pilot phase (Phase II) of a      stepped-wedge cluster RCT of a well-developed and defined complex OHC intervention versus      usual OHC. Investigators aim to establish a robust web-based randomisation process, refine      the proposed intervention (training, tools, equipment), recruitment, adherence, record      linkage and sampling methodologies.

NCT04047134,Neuroimaging Biomarkers Toward a Personalized Upper Limb Action Observation Treatment in Chronic Stroke Patients,"~     Much recent interest was raised by the use of Action Observation Treatment (AOT) in stroke~     patients rehabilitation. AOT, well-grounded in neurophysiology, is an updated approach, based~     on mirror neuron system (MNS) used to rebuild motor function despite injuries by engaging the~     brain regions active during action execution in individuals with limited mobility. This~     project aims at identifying, for the first time in Italy, neurophysiological~     electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers able to predict rehabilitation outcomes and~     providing an innovative optimized AOT rehabilitation protocol for chronic Stroke outpatients.~     EEG will be recorded to identify the most effective stimuli, quantify changes/recovery,~     profile patients.~      Moreover, an innovative AOT home-based program will be implemented. The translational~     research results will ensure advances in the optimization and personalization of the~     rehabilitative process thus contributing to improve the quality of life of chronic stroke~     patients.~      Stroke is a leading cause of death and one of the greatest causes of long-term disability~     that interferes with a good quality of life. Nowadays the rehabilitation interventions are~     the major component of patient's care to achieve functional outcome. In the last few years,~     in order to improve Activity of Daily Living (ADL), new noninvasive strategies have emerged~     as rehabilitative treatments rather than traditional physical therapies. The Action~     Observation Treatment (AOT), supported by results collected through randomized controlled~     trials, is one of these. This new rehabilitation approach is based on the properties of the~     Mirror Neuron System (MNS; 11-13). The extensive research of the last 20 years on the human~     MNS (hMNS) showed its importance not only in action recognition but also in motor intentions~     and other social cognitive functions. Lastly, because recruited also in damage brain (18,19),~     the MNS is demonstrated to provide satisfactory rehabilitative outcomes. The AOT takes~     advantage of the opportunity to restore functions despite the patient's impairment and it~     seems to be a valid example of translational medicine from basic neuroscience to~     rehabilitation. To date, neurophysiological outcomes were never used for translational~     purposes aimed to the optimization of the therapy and no evidence, in Italy, related to the~     effectiveness of the home-based program were proposed.~   ",C0038454;C0376495,C0392335;C0007465;C2728259;C1522240;C2728259;C0038454;C0038454;C0006104;C0006104;C0013819;C0013819;C0013819;C0184511;C0184511;C0376495;C0038454;C0038454;C1320102;C0009240;C0949766;C2004454;C3834249;C0204601;C0204601;C0204601;C0204601;C0204601;C0204601;C0376495;C0376495,0,0,1,0,0,0.003378315,0.002151982,0,5,0.020139749

NCT01309165,Exploring the Efficacy of Combined Task-Specific and Cognitive Strategy Training in Subacute Stroke,"Novel stroke rehabilitation approaches, such as task-specific training (TST), have shown      promise in improving stroke recovery components such as basic mobility and activities of      daily living; however, evidence suggests these improvements are not generalized and      transferred to home, community, or work settings, and usually do not impact overall      participation outcomes. Further, these treatments are very intense, with total treatment      times as high as 30 to 60 hours, making them clinically or economically unfeasible in many      settings. In contrast, approaches incorporating cognitive strategy training have shown great      promise to not only improve functional activity performance in people living with stroke, but      also to facilitate generalization and transfer beyond the clinical setting, and to do so in      10 to 15 treatment hours. Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) is      an established treatment approach that uses cognitive strategies in combination with TST.      Evidence from other research groups and findings from our own participant interview data      indicate that the approach may be even more effective if introduced much earlier in the      rehabilitation process, however, CO-OP has not yet been tested in this sub-acute population.      Therefore, the specific project goals are: 1. To refine the CO-OP treatment approach for use      with people less than three months post stroke; 2. To evaluate, in a Phase II clinical trial,      the preliminary efficacy of the refined protocol compared to standard occupational therapy on      immediate and longer-term skill performance and participation; 3. To determine effect sizes      for power calculations for a future Phase III clinical trial to test the new protocol versus      contemporary treatment.

NCT01062308,STRIPS: Shoulder Taping Reduces Injury and Pain in Stroke,"Background and Rationale: The most commonly seen disabilities in stroke patients are shoulder      injuries such as shoulder pain, glenohumeral subluxation, spasticity of shoulder muscles,      soft-tissue trauma, rotator cuff tears, and shoulder-hand syndrome.      Taping is widely used in the field of rehabilitation as both means of treatment and      prevention of sports related injuries. Scarce information is available regarding the use of      shoulder taping in preventing shoulder injuries in stroke patients. Aims:      To find out the effectiveness of taping technique with conventional treatment versus sham      taping and conventional treatment in prevention of shoulder injuries in patients with acute      stroke.      Hypothesis:      Taping technique with conventional treatment will be superior to conventional treatment alone      in preventing shoulder injuries in patients with acute stroke.      Methods Research setting: Stroke unit, department of Neurology, Christian Medical College      (CMC) Ludhiana, Punjab, India and College of Physiotherapy, CMC Ludhiana.      Study design: prospective, randomized, outcome blinded trial (PROBE design). Study period:      Prospective for 18 months from May 2009 All stroke patients with upper limb weakness within      48 hours after the ictus and with Brunnstrom's stage of recovery 1 and 2 will be included in      the study. Patients will be randomized into two groups using lottery method. The treatment      arm group(Group I) include shoulder taping with conventional techniques that is(positioning,      handling technique and passive range of motion exercises) and the control arm (Group II)      include sham taping with conventional techniques with sham taping. A total of 80 patients in      each group will be included. The plastic micropore and elastic adhesive tape will be used for      taping the affected shoulder. The sham taping will be done using the same tapes but without      stretching the concerned muscles and joints. The tapes will be changed every 3 days and will      remain for 14 days. The outcome measures are as follows; Primary: Pain: Visual Analog Scale      and Activities of daily living: Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI); Secondary: Range      of motion: using a Goniometer. The outcome will be assessed by an independent physiotherapist      who will be blinded to the clinical details. Patients will be followed-up at 14 days and 30      days.

NCT03458169,LEAP a New Overground Body Weight Support Robot: Usability Trial,"~     People with central nervous system disorders such as spinal cord injury, stroke, cerebral~     palsy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, etc? often have impaired lower extremity~     function that limits activities of daily life and independence. Different body-weight support~     systems have been developed to facilitate the rehabilitation process by compensating for the~     user's residual abilities. However, studies on weight-supported gait training on a treadmill~     have failed to show superiority over conventional rehabilitation programs for spinal cord~     injury and stroke. A recent study by the group around Gr?goire Courtine showed that~     body-weight support systems that provide assistance only in the vertical direction disrupt~     the production of gait and balance, suggesting that current practices may even be detrimental~     for relearning to walk. For the past year, the Clinique Romande de R?adaptation (CRR) worked~     together with the G-Lab at EPFL and G-Therapeutics on a new robot platform specifically~     developed to provide adjustable trunk support along four independent degrees of freedom~     (LEAP). The investigators were able to draw on their long-term experience, which consists of~     different body weight support training systems for stroke and spinal cord injury. This~     knowledge, combined with the input of our therapists and physicians and the specific~     requirements for people with neurological/musculoskeletal disorders, has resulted in a design~     that can provide adjustable bodyweight support during over-ground locomotion, treadmill,~     stairs training, standing up and sitting down and for support during the training of~     activities of daily living.~      The scope of this study is to examine how well the robot can be used for rehabilitation~     therapy in everyday clinical practice. This includes, among other things, technical aspects~     such as the handling of the hardware, the adaptability of the robot to the patient, and the~     safety during operation (such as the fall prevention). Various patient-specific aspects will~     also be evaluated e.g. comfort, positioning, or motivation of the patient.

NCT01366729,Gait Rehabilitation Post Stroke:the Long Term Effect of Two Walking Aids -Canes and TheraTogs,"Background 9000 people a year in Switzerland suffer a first time stroke. Of these 20 to 30%      remain unable to walk and up to 60% are left with moderate to severe walking disability.      Evidence shows that rehabilitation techniques which emphasise use of the hemiplegic side      influence ipsilesional cortical plasticity and improve functional outcomes. Canes are      commonly used in gait rehabilitation although they significantly reduce hemiplegic muscle      activity. We have shown that an orthosis ""TheraTogs"" ( elastic corset supporting hemiplegic      side) significantly increases hemiplegic muscle activity during gait.      To date no clinical studies have investigated the long term effects of these techniques on      gait recovery following stroke.      This study aims to determine if advances in the understanding of cortical plasticity and its      relation to functional recovery following stroke can be applied to clinical gait      rehabilitation to improve long term outcomes.      Hypotheses Early gait rehabilitation with canes will reduce hemiplegic muscle activity and      inhibit balance reactions. In the long term this causes poorer walking ability and balance      and consequently reduced social participation.      Early gait rehabilitation with TheraTogs will increase hemiplegic muscle activity and      facilitate balance reactions. In the long term this improves walking ability and balance      leading to increased social independence and participation.      Design Multi-centred, single blind, randomized control trial. Subjects 120 first time stroke      patients Intervention When subjects can walk unaided on even ground whilst requiring verbal      prompts and stand-by help without body contact (FAC 3) they will be randomly allocated into      intervention (TheraTogs) or control (cane) group. TheraTogs will be applied to support hip      extensor and abductor musculature according to a standardized procedure. Cane walking with      cane at the level of the radial styloid of the sound wrist. Subjects will walk throughout the      day with the assigned walking aid. Standard therapy treatments and usual care will remain      unchanged and documented.The intervention will continue for five weeks or until patients have      reached FAC 5 (independent walkers on all surfaces).      Measures: the day before intervention begin, the day after intervention completion (max 5      weeks), 3 months, 6 months and 2 years after completion Primary outcome Timed ""up and go""      test Secondary outcomes surface EMG of hemiplegic lower extremity musculature,      temporo-spatial gait parameters, hip kinematics, dynamic balance.

NCT02910427,The Effect of Intervention With Potassium and/ or Magnesium-enriched Salt on Neurological Performance of Stroke Patients,"Cerebrovascular disease is the second leading cause of death in Taiwan. Although stroke      incidence and mortality decline steadily in Taiwan, its impact on medical cost, quality of      life and neurological deficits remains extraordinary. Stroke incidence and mortality are also      rising in the developed countries presumably due to a world-wide increase in prevalence of      obesity and metabolic syndrome. Negative associations have been observed between high blood      pressure, hyperglycemia and two major dietary cations in vegetables and dairy products:      potassium and magnesium. Mean levels of dietary potassium and magnesium intake in Taiwan are      much lower than those of dietary reference intake. Short term supplementation studies have      demonstrated their effects in reducing blood pressure and degree of insulin resistance.      However, long-term studies on cardiovascular events are lacking. Our previous long-term      intervention trial in elderly veteran home showed a 41% reduction in cardiovascular mortality      by simply switching regular cooking salt to potassium-enriched salt in kitchens.

NCT04000997,The Predictive Value of Peak Cough Flow for Endotracheal Extubation of Patients After Craniotomy,"~     In severe cases after craniotomy, tracheal intubation is often required, and the removal of~     tracheal intubation presents certain risks and challenges. Premature removal of the tracheal~     intubation can lead to failure of extubation and increased proportion of re-intubation,~     resulting in increased risk of airway injury and hospital-acquired pneumonia, resulting in~     prolonged hospital stay and even adverse effects on neurological outcomes and mortality. .~     However, delayed extubation can also lead to an increased risk of hospital acquired~     pneumonia, affecting early recovery and neurological recovery. It can be seen that the~     accurate evaluation of the possibility of tracheal intubation and the appropriate timing can~     have a greater impact on the prognosis of patients after craniotomy. However, there are~     currently no relevant standards or guidelines to guide clinical work. Previous studies have~     shown that for general critically ill patients, Peak cough flow (PCF) can play a certain role~     in predicting tracheal intubation, but the results of each study are not consistent. The~     predictive value of PCF for tracheal intubation and extubation in patients after craniotomy~     is less relevant. This study intends to use Pneumotachograph to measure the active and~     passive PCF of patients with extubation, to explore the predictive value of PCF for tracheal~     intubation after craniotomy, and to provide guidance for the development of clinical~     extubation decisions.~   ",0,C0879626;C0220825;C0162791;C0032285;C0032285;C2004454;C2004454;C0805586;C0040578;C0040578;C0150312;C0040578;C0040578;C0040578;C1320102;C0040578;C0040578,0,0,0,0,0,0.000224618,0.000858995,0,5,0.01830928

NCT02148939,Antiplatelet Effects in Stroke-Patients,"Many patients suffer from acute and chronic pain. The incidence of chronic pain correlates      with increased age. Most of patients rely on analgesic medication to control the pain.      Dipyrone is an extensively used drug in Western and Eastern Europe as well as Central and      South America, largely due to its favorable analgesic and antipyretic effects in conjunction      with a low incidence of gastrointestinal complications when compared to other non-steroidal      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).      Aspirin is the backbone of antiplatelet therapy in patients after ischemic stroke. However,      it is known that there are substantial inter-individual response variabilities to      antiplatelet medication. Furthermore, patients with impaired response to aspirin have a      significant higher risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events. The investigators have recently      shown that co-medication with aspirin and dipyrone in patients with coronary artery disease      lead to insufficient antiplatelet effects of aspirin.      The incidence of chronic pain is very high in patients with ischemic stroke. Therefore, in      this study the investigators aim to examine, if co-medication of aspirin and dipyrone      interaction also occurs in patients after ischemic stroke.",C0038454;C1550655,C0161819;C0280004;C0010054;C1096021;C0948008;C0948008;C0948008;C0150055;C0150055;C0150055;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0002771;C0442804;C0012586;C0037949;C1704632;C1704632;C0012586;C0012586;C0004057;C0004057;C0004057;C0004057;C0004057;C0683278;C0003211;C0013227;C0947630;C0030193;C1273517;C0013227;C1442948;C1550472;C0003209;C0000589;C1518681;C1518681;C3843761;C0038317;C1879652;C0151576,0,0,0,1,1,0.00367304,0.002216475,1,2,0.018210457

NCT02814760,Impact Of A Training Program And Organization On The Management Of Stroke In The Acute Phase (AVC-II),"Acute stroke management represents a true medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis      and urgent treatment. In a previous exhaustive cohort study conducted in the Rh?ne region,      France (AVC69) (Porthault et al. 2013) the investigators observed that only a small      percentage of patients could access to thrombolysis in time. In this cohort of 1306 patients      treated in one of the emergency department of the Rhone region for a suspected stroke, 84% of      patients reached hospital through an emergency department instead of going directly to a      stroke unit. Among those patients, only 2% were finally thrombolysed. A significant part of      patients arrived in the emergency department too late to be thrombolysed. However, among the      subset of ischemic stroke patients who reach emergency department less than 3 hours after      symptoms onset, and who had no clinical or radiological exclusion criteria for thrombolysis,      only 15 % were thrombolysed. The hypothesis was that an intervention designed to improve ED      professional's knowledge and skills and to develop together efficient clinical pathway would      decrease door-to imaging time and consequently door-to needle time and eventually improve      overall thrombolysis rate.      The investigators have conducted a cluster randomized controlled stepped wedge trial. All      adult patients with suspected stroke arriving in one of the participating ED were included in      the study along five successive four-month periods. The program featured: development of      written materials (booklets) and video (film), and one day session of standardized training      for trainers, at least one nurse and one physician of all EDs, with formal presentation to      improve knowledge, and simulation to improve skills for using the ""FAST"" tool (nurses) and      the ""NIHSS"" score (ED physicians).

NCT01325545,Detection of Occult Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Using Prolonged Ambulatory Cardiac Monitoring,"About one-third of patients with stroke have no documented cause for the cerebrovascular      event (known as cryptogenic strokes). Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of stroke, but      when transient (paroxysmal) it may remain undiagnosed. Recent data suggest that occult      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may be identified in patients with cryptogenic strokes using      prolonged ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitors.      The investigators designed this study pursuing the following goals:        1. To determine the prevalence of occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with           cryptogenic stroke using long-term mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry.        2. To compare this prevalence to that found in a control group with stroke of known,           non-cardioembolic cause.        3. To look for clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic, and imaging data that serve as risk           factors for occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke.        4.

NCT01847157,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Combined Sensory Modulation Intervention in Chronic Stroke Patients,"Background and purpose:      About 30% of people with stroke suffered from severe long-term upper extremity (UE) motor      impairment. Severe UE impairment, especially dysfunction of hand, can greatly impact stroke      patients' daily living independence and quality of life. However, treatment effect of current      interventions is still limited. Nick Ward and Leonardo Cohen suggested 5 intervention      strategies for stroke motor recovery: (1) reduction of somatosensory input from the intact;      (2) increase in somatosensory input from the paretic; (3) anesthesia of a body part proximal      to the paretic hand; (4) activity within the affected motor cortex may be up-regulated; (5)      activity within the intact motor cortex may be down-regulated. Recent studies have shown each      strategy to be effective in stroke patients with mild or moderate UE impairment. However,      evidence for people with severe UE impairment after stroke remains unclear. Since research      has found a greater effect for combined strategies than a single strategy, this proposal      develops a combined intervention with the above 5 strategies, named ""transcranial direct      current stimulation (tDCS) combined sensory modulation intervention"". This intervention is      expected to be most effective for people with severe UE impairment after stroke.      In addition, neuroimaging can provide in vivo information about the brain plasticity which      underpinning the motor recovery after stroke. However, image indexes that can be used in      stroke patients with severe UE impairment remained examined. Therefore, this proposal has 3      aims: (1) to examine the treatment effect of the ""tDCS combined sensory modulation      intervention"" in stroke patients with severe UE impairment; (2) to examine the underline      mechanism of the efficacy of ""tDCS combined sensory modulation intervention"" using      neuroimaging technology.      Methods:      This study is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial which will recruit 60 people who      have had stroke onset more than 6 months and have severe UE motor impairment. All      participants will be randomly assigned into 2 groups. The experimental group will be given      the ""tDCS combined sensory modulation intervention"", combining bilateral tDCS stimulation,      anesthesia techniques and repetitive passive motor training. The control group is given sham      tDCS, sham anesthesia and repetitive passive motor training. Each group will be evaluated for      outcomes at 4 time points (i.e. baseline, post-intervention, 3 months and 6months      post-intervention). The immediate and long-term effect of the interventions will be examined.      Primary outcome indicators include upper extremity impairment measures. Secondary outcome      measures include upper extremity function, activities of daily living function, functional      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and corticospinal tract structural integrity using      diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI). Fifteen subjects of each group will be assessed 2 times      (i.e., prior to the intervention and after the intervention) for fMRI and DSI scan.      Anticipatory results and contributions:      The results of the studies are expected to present a potentially effective intervention for      stroke patients with severe impaired UE motor. Imaging evidence of brain plasticity for this      particular intervention is also provided.

NCT00109382,Fast Assessment of Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack to Prevent Early Recurrence (FASTER),"Current management of patients with TIA (transient ischemic attack) or minor stroke includes      the prompt investigation and treatment in the days and weeks after the event. However, new      evidence shows patients are at the highest risk of stroke in the first few days after the      TIA, with 50% of strokes which happen in the three months following TIA occurring within      48-72 hours. To date, there is no evidence to guide physicians on how to safely reduce this      risk.      The FASTER trial is focusing on the initial period of high risk, starting patients on stroke      prevention treatments in the hours following a TIA or minor stroke. The drugs to be tested      have been shown to be effective in the similar setting of cardiology, reducing recurrent      cardiac events in patients with unstable angina when commenced with the same speed after an      event.      All patients will be on aspirin. The trial will see if adding another drug, clopidogrel, has      an additional benefit in reducing the number of strokes after TIA or minor stroke within      three months of TIA or minor stroke. It will also look if the very early introduction of      simvastatin, a cholesterol lowering therapy, reduces stroke after TIA or minor stroke, both      by itself and in addition to clopidogrel. The final aim of the trial is to ensure that these      treatments are safe to be used in this population of patients.",C0007787;C4055086;C0031809;C0038454;C0015663;C0012082,C0007787;C0002965;C0741923;C1552578;C0070166;C0074554;C0070166;C0376636;C0199176;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0332167;C0038454;C0542559;C0004057;C0038454;C0087111;C0038454;C0038454;C0025344;C0038454;C0038454;C0392366;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0013227;C0002658;C0013227;C1273517;C1578513;C0042789;C1820370;C0376495;C0201950;C0776963;C1561542;C1561542;C0018792;C0018792;C0018792,0,0,0,76,76,0.001941934,0.001962729,0,2,0.017386558
NCT02079103,Virtual Reality Training for Upper Extremity After Stroke,Background: High intensity training of challenging tasks with many repetitions is a key      factor for regaining motor function after stroke. Novel virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation      systems provide the potential to increase intensity and offer challenging and motivating      tasks. The efficacy of VR systems has not been demonstrated yet in sufficiently powered      studies.      Methods: In 5 participating rehabilitation centers patients in the subacute phase after      stroke will be randomized to either a group receiving 4 weeks of VR training in addition to      conventional arm training or a group receiving dose-matched and therapist attention-matched      conventional arm-training.

NCT01864928,Rapid Evaluation for Stroke Outcomes Using Lytics in Vascular Event (RESOLVE) Registry and Implementation Quality Improvement Study,"Despite abundant evident supporting the use of acute reperfusion therapy in the setting of      acute ischemic stroke (AIS), adoption of this practice in routine clinical care is poor. We      hypothesize that a significant barrier is the difficulty in weighing the benefits and risks      of rt-PA treatment in the care of an individual patient, a problem compounded by the time      urgency of decision-making and clinical fears that weigh risks of treatment more heavily than      benefits.      The goal of this Quality Improvement (QI) study is to leverage an IT solution that we have      developed, ePRISM, that executes multivariable risk models with patient-specific data so that      a personalized estimate of an individual's outcomes (both risks and benefits) with and      without rt-PA, can be generated so support safer, more effective clinical care.

NCT02725853,Enhancing Recovery of Arm Movement in Stroke Patients,"~     Many people who have had a stroke have problems recovering the use of their affected arm and~     these problems may persist for a long time. The investigators' research will test new ways to~     boost recovery by using non-painful brain stimulation together with training of arm movements~     using basic science principles. The training program will be done using the latest technology~     in rehabilitation such as virtual reality and robotics. The investigators will compare three~     groups of patients who have had a stroke. Each group will receive different combinations of~     brain stimulation and arm training. Another aspect of this proposal is that the investigators~     will do the same training programs in three different countries - Canada, Israel and India.~     In this way, the investigators will combine knowledge and skills to create training programs~     that can be applied anywhere in the world and that are not necessarily limited to high-income~     countries. Also, by combining expertise, the investigators will help to build the capacity to~     do research in India, a middle-income country that has great potential to contribute new~     knowledge to rehabilitation medicine.~   ",C2004454;C0026649;C0038454;C0446516,C0376554;C0376554;C2004454;C2728259;C0038454;C0038454;C0006104;C0006104;C0446516;C0446516;C0446516;C0033213;C0033213;C2728259;C0026649;C2728259;C3834249;C0204601;C0204601,0,0,-1,0,0,0.00222879,0.002181458,0,0,0.017108005
NCT01189058,Modulation of Brain Plasticity After Perinatal Stroke,"Newborn stroke is the leading cause of a common type of cerebral palsy (CP) that affects      thousands of Canadian children and families. Treatments for CP are generally ineffective, and      have traditionally focused on the weak body rather than the injured brain. Understanding how      the newborn brain responds to injuries like stroke (plasticity) carries the greatest      potential for better treatments. We propose to study the ability of two interventions to      modulate brain plasticity toward better function in children with stroke-induced CP. One is a      rehabilitation method called constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), the other is a type      of non-invasive brain stimulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is safe      and comfortable for children and we recently showed it could improve motor function in      children with stroke.      We will perform a special study to test both treatments simultaneously. Children 7-18 years      with stroke-induced CP will be recruited into the study from across Alberta. Each child will      randomly receive either TMS, CIMT, both, or neither each day for two weeks while attending      our new HemiKids Power Camp for motor learning. Improvements will be measured by trained      therapists over 1 year. TMS will also measure brain plasticity, both initially and following      treatment. Our lead investigator is an expert in both newborn stroke and TMS and has      assembled an experienced team of accomplished collaborators to ensure the completion of this      important work. This will be the largest study of children with CP examined in this manner.      This will be the first clinical trial of non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS) in CP, the      largest trial of CIMT (and the first exclusive to newborn stroke), and the first study      allowing the direct comparison of two different therapies. In establishing the first      dedicated pediatric TMS laboratory in Canada, we will be the first to measure plasticity      changes in newborn stroke, advancing new treatments of this previously untreatable and      disabling disease.      Patient recruitment is currently underway at Alberta Children's Hospital.

NCT00132483,ExStroke Pilot Trial: Physical Exercise After Acute Ischaemic Stroke,"Summary      This study will look at physical exercise after acute ischaemic stroke. It is called the      ExStroke Pilot Trial.      Physical activity is associated with a lower risk of first-time stroke. It remains unknown if      physical activity also is associated with a lower risk of recurrent stroke. Patients with      ischaemic stroke have a 30% to 40% risk of a recurrent stroke during a 5 year follow-up. The      risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and death from vascular disease is approximately 15%      each. The impact of lifestyle factors on risk for these events is insufficiently covered in      the international scientific literature.      Purpose:      The purpose of the trial is to examine whether the level of physical activity increases in      patients who have had an ischemic stroke, when they are informed about physical activity and      instructed in a physical training program. The occurrence of new cerebro- and cardiovascular      events in the patients will be registered. The patients are randomised to receive oral and      written information by a physician and a physiotherapist about physical exercise; or to a      control group with no instruction regarding physical exercise. Both groups will receive the      best available therapy with regard to secondary stroke prevention and will be informed about      lifestyle factors.      Irrespective of which group the patients are randomised to, all patients will receive the      best possible established treatment with regard to prevention of thromboses; blood pressure      control; lipid lowering agents, if necessary; and information about diet, tobacco smoking,      and vitamin supplements.      Study Design:      The patients will be randomised centrally within 90 days after stroke onset, and they will be      re-examined at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.

NCT01769703,Dabigatran Treatment Following Transient Ischemic Attack and Minor Stroke,"Objective: Demonstrate the safety of early use of dabigatran following TIA/minor stroke.      Background: Although aggressive antithrombotic therapy has been shown to reduce the number of      new ischemic events following stroke/TIA, this has always been offset by an increase in the      risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Dabigatran is much safer than previously tested      antithrombotic agents, with respect to intracranial bleeding and therefore offers a unique      treatment opportunity in these high-risk patients. TIA/minor stroke represent the largest      group of cerebrovascular disease patients. A short-term intervention such as 30 days of      dabigatran treatment has the potential for a very large impact from the population health      perspective, given the number of patients who may be treated if a benefit can be      demonstrated.      Study design:      This is an open label, single arm study. Patients with TIA/minor stroke (National Institutes      of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score </=3) who can be treated within 24 hours of symptom      onset will be eligible. All patients will be treated with dabigatran for 30 days. The dose of      dabigatran will be determined by age and renal function (patients >80 years old and/or with      GFR 30-50 ml/min will received 110 mg bid, and all other patients will receive 150 mg      BID).The primary endpoint is symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. Patients (n=50) with      TIA/minor stroke, defined as having a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score of      </=3, will undergo an MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), as well as gradient      recall echo (GRE) sequences, which will be used to assess for hemorrhagic transformation.      Patients will have a repeat MRI examination at 7 and 30 days to assess for hemorrhagic      transformation and new lesion development. The primary endpoint of of phase I is symptomatic      hemorrhagic transformation, defined as a parenchymal hematoma on the day 7 MRI scan (GRE      sequence), associated with clinical worsening (>/=4 point increase in National Institutes of      Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score).

NCT01745692,Pragmatic Ischaemic Stroke Thrombectomy Evaluation,"Ischaemic strokes (those caused by blockage in an artery in the brain caused by a blood clot)      can be treated with very early use of clot-busting (thrombolytic) drugs to attempt to restore      the blood supply and limit the damage, resulting in an increased proportion of people making      a recovery to independence after stroke. However, drug treatment only succeed in restoring      blood flow in a minority of people with clots in the larger arteries (10-25% depending on the      size of the blood vessel) and these people also have the most severe strokes and highest risk      of death or dependence as a result of the stroke. Current best treatment is therefore least      effective in the group with the most severe strokes. Devices that can be fed through the      blood vessels to either remove or break up the blood clot in the brain vessels can open this      type of large artery blockage. However, using these devices is a highly skilled procedure and      it takes some time both to set up the necessary facilities (including anaesthetic, nurses and      medical support) and to reach the blockage. The extra time that is required to use these      devices may mean that brain tissue is already irreversibly damaged. If so, then an individual      patient cannot benefit and indeed may be harmed by opening the artery. There are no completed      clinical trials comparing the outcome in people treated with standard stroke treatment and      those treated with devices. PISTE is a randomised, controlled trial to test whether      additional mechanical thrombectomy device treatment improves functional outcome in patients      with large artery occlusion who are given IV thrombolytic drug treatment as standard care.",C0162578;C0220825;C0038454,C0016018;C0264995;C1096775;C0005847;C0016018;C0678861;C0005847;C0226003;C0162578;C0087086;C0232338;C0439857;C0087086;C0087111;C0087111;C0184661;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0003842;C3245501;C2828392;C2828392;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0005847;C0003842;C0010957;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C0205082;C0003842;C0038454;C0006104;C0013227;C0302148;C0011065;C0006104;C0006104;C3244317;C0302148;C0013227;C0392366;C0036849;C0002932;C0439857;C2004454;C0025080;C0010957;C0849759;C2911690;C0031843;C1552839;C1101725;C1328018;C0018792;C1706968;C1706968;C1706968;C0184511;C0332155;C0332155;C0332155;C3843352;C0151576,0,0,0,19,9.5,0.002450558,0.002453849,0,5,0.016606115

Firstly, in symptomatic patients with a 30-69%~     stenosis, who are currently not operated upon according to the current guidelines,~     identification of the risk of rupture plaque could identify patients who have a high risk of~     recurrent stroke, and would benefit of carotid intervention, such as endarterectomy or stent~     placement. This could potentially prevent a substantial number of strokes. Secondly, in all~     symptomatic patients with a 70-99% stenosis carotid intervention should be considered,~     according to the guidelines. However, only one out of six patients with a 70-99% stenosis~     benefits from a carotid intervention.

NCT02523261,Interest of Direct Aspiration First Pass Technique (ADAPT) for Thrombectomy Revascularisation of Large Vessel Occlusion in Acute Ischaemic Stroke,"Mechanical thrombectomy (TM) is now validated through 4 randomized controlled trials of high      scientific level as the reference treatment of cerebral infarction associated with proximal      cerebral occlusion (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE 2014, 2015). These studies have shown for the first time      a major decrease (-35%) of disability related to severe cerebral infarction and reduction in      mortality. These studies only used thrombectomy devices called stent retriever for obtaining      recanalization rates ranging from 58-72% for the 2 largest studies (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE 2014,      2015). This criterion ""recanalization"" is important because it largely determines the      functional prognosis of patients with severe cerebral infarction (Khatri, 2014).      These results are exciting but we can do even better. Indeed, already new thrombectomy      devices are available with a special interest for ADAPT (A Direct Aspiration First Pass      Technic). This distal suction system, with a high level of endovascular navigability,      provides high recanalization rates (> 90%), low morbidity, with a synergistic effect with      stent retriever (Turk A, Kowoll 2014 and 2015). To date, these technic (ADAPT) has never been      assessed in a randomized controlled trial.      We have previously conducted a comparative observational study between two recanalization      strategies by thrombectomy using first-line ADAPT or the most widely used stent retriever.      The interventional neuroradiologist could, in case of recanalization failure with the      Solitaire system, used another thrombectomy material left to the operator's choice. 244      consecutive patients on two centers (Rothschild Foundation, and Foch Hospital, France)      admitted for a cerebral infarction associated with proximal occlusion were included. This is      so far the largest series of patients with ADAPT system. The complete recanalization rate was      84% with ADAPT versus 68% with stent retriever (P = 0.006). Unpublished data, Oral      presentation at the European Stroke Organization, April 2015). Our research aims to show that      a first line strategy of recanalization by thrombectomy using a distal suction system (ADAPT)      is superior that the use of a stent retriever.",C0162578;C0220787;C0543488;C1552596;C0005847;C0038454;C1547229;C2828386;C0581603;C0028778,C0282440;C0282440;C4534538;C0007785;C0007785;C0007785;C0007785;C0596298;C0034771;C0034771;C0034771;C0034771;C0034771;C0034771;C0034771;C0162578;C0162578;C0524425;C0162578;C0162578;C1552679;C0162578;C0231170;C0220787;C0679199;C1514811;C0087111;C4551656;C0033325;C0220880;C0028778;C0543488;C0184666;C0679199;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0038638;C0038638;C0870509;C0205082;C0870509;C0205082;C1552596;C1518681;C0038454;C0038257;C0038257;C0947630;C0038257;C0038257;C0038257;C1273517;C2828386;C1273517;C1273517;C3245479;C1578513;C1550472;C0442797;C0184661;C1964257;C0233492;C0233256;C0031843;C4084912;C0729829;C0729829;C4489236;C1555587;C1705273;C4489236;C4283785;C0701928,0,0,0,18,4.5,0.001914261,0.002261475,0,3,0.014590445

All~     National Health Service primary care units in the Lisbon (Portugal) region will be invited to~     participate. Units will be eligible if they are using an Electronic Health Record to issue~     prescriptions and have at least four doctors willing to participate. Doctors in intervention~     units will receive three educational outreach visits (one for each guideline) during a six~     months period, while the control group doctors will be offered an unrelated group training~     session (on using the international classification for primary care). Intervention visits~     will be one on one 15 minutes discussions conducted by guideline authors or trained family~     physicians at the physician's workplace. There are two primary outcomes, measured at the~     physician's level. One is the proportion of COX-2 inhibitors prescribed within the entire~     NSAID class, in defined daily doses 18 months after the intervention. The other is the~     proportion of omeprazole within the entire proton pump inhibitors class, in defined daily~     doses at 18 months post-intervention. Prescription data will be collected from the regional~     pharmacy claims database.~   ",C0162791;C0678257,C0358591;C0358591;C0162791;C0162791;C3714738;C0162791;C0162791;C3714738;C0162791;C0028978;C0025663;C3687832;C2946261;C0456387;C0456387;C2362543;C0162791;C0162791;C0544691;C0678257;C0678257;C0678257;C0678257;C2986419,0,0,0,2,1,0.000582217,0.000432536,1,4,0.014334602
NCT01339195,Post-stroke Cognitive Impairment and Dementia,"Projections from epidemiological studies suggest that, among the Western adult population,      one in three will present a cerebrovascular accident (stroke), severe cognitive disorders, or      both. To better diagnose the Vascular Cognitive Impairment, new standards were developed by a      North America working group which are under validation. It is essential to adapt these      standard for French-speaking population, and especially to define cutoff scores of the      cognitive battery to determine cognitive deficit.      The investigators propose a study coordinated by the University-Hospital of Amiens for french      speaking centers.

NCT01378780,Stroke Health and Risk Education (SHARE),"Stroke is a disease with tremendous individual, family, and societal impact. It is the number      one cause of adult disability and third leading cause of death in the United States. Between      now and the year 2050, the cost of stroke in the United States will exceed 2 trillion      dollars. There is a tremendous ethnic disparity with respect to stroke in the United States.      Mexican Americans are much more likely to have a stroke compared with European Americans. In      Mexican Americans strokes occur at younger ages, are more likely to recur and have the same      severity as they do in European Americans. Mexican Americans are the overwhelming largest      sub-population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group. This proposal, a      scientifically-based rigorous behavioral education intervention trial, seeks to aggressively      prevent stroke, especially in Mexican Americans.      Faith and family are strong components of Mexican American culture. This project works with      these positive fundamental elements in order to affect stroke prevention. This project will      take place in Nueces County, Texas. The project investigators have worked in this community      for the past 14 years and have published extensively regarding the stroke health disparity in      this stable, non-immigrant community of Mexican Americans and European Americans. We have      established a strong partnership with the Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi and assembled a      team with tremendous experience at successful health behavior intervention research.      Together, a proposal has been crafted that will directly speak to aggressive stroke risk      factor reduction in Mexican Americans and European Americans in this representative United      States community.      The significance of such research is tremendous. As the Mexican American population grows and      ages, the stroke impact will be felt with greater and greater intensity. Now is the time to      develop aggressive, scientifically tested interventions to limit the burden of this disease      on this important segment of the United States population, and to reduce the costs of this      disease to the country as a whole, in keeping with the Government Performance and Results Act      (GPRA) goal to ""identify culturally appropriate, effective stroke prevention programs for      nationwide implementation in minority communities"" by FY2010.",C0013658;C0038454;C1328956,C0679717;C1277289;C1171307;C0518902;C0007465;C0886296;C0184661;C0184661;C1277291;C0231170;C0237607;C0424927;C4551656;C1948033;C1446409;C1948033;C0012634;C0038454;C0012634;C0012634;C1550710;C0038454;C1301584;C0038454;C0680174;C0038454;C0332148;C0038454;C0332148;C0038454;C1301584;C0001721;C0038454;C0227813;C0038454;C0392366;C0038454;C0600116;C1561543;C0018017;C2825142;C2986890;C1547300;C1547300;C1704324;C4084912;C3858576;C1706074;C1328018;C1552839;C0018792;C1522411;C4086497;C0282547;C2363670;C1881720,0,0,0,9,4.5,0.002294566,0.001766965,0,3,0.014236724

The primary objective of this study is to determine whether CPAP adherence in stroke patients      with obstructive sleep apnea can be improved by a CPAP training strategy during      rehabilitation combined with a telemedicine monitoring system after discharge.      The secondary objective is to compare recording quality as well as subjective and objective      sleep data of non-attended level III polygraphy, polysomnography and telemetric CPAP data in      the management of sleep apnea in stroke.      Further the investigators aim to study changes in nocturnal systolic blood pressure due to      CPAP therapy with the pulse transit time method.      Finally, the investigators intend to study the relationship between CPAP compliance, sleep      and medical and neurorehabilition outcome parameters.      Design:      Single-blind, mono-center, randomized controlled trial on standard CPAP treatment as compared      with CPAP treatment with a telemedicine monitoring system in stroke patients with moderate to      severe OSA.      Setting: Neurorehabilitation center in Vienna, Austria      Patients: Adult subacute (1 to 12 months post stroke) stroke patients 18-70 yrs of age) with      moderate to severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index (AHI) = 15/hr) determined by non-attended      polysomnography (AHI) = 15/hr of sleep) or level III polygraphy (AHI) = 30/hr of      out-of-center sleep testing (OCST), who undergo successful CPAP training and titration (goal      AHI< 10) at the neurorehabilitation unit.      Interventions: Patients will be randomized to either standard care with an autotitrating CPAP      device or an autotitrating CPAP device that transmits physiologic information (i.e.,      adherence, air leak, residual AHI) daily to a website that will be reviewed by their homecare      provider.

NCT02735148,The Effects of Body Weight Supported Treadmill Training On Balance In Stroke Patients,"~     Stroke is one of the most common causes of acquired adult disability. The majority of stroke~     survivors have mobility difficulties such as poor standing, decreased walking speed, balance~     disturbances, and increased risk for falls. Improving mobility, functional walking and~     balance are the main goals of stroke rehabilitation. Robotic technologies are becoming more~     promising intervention for the locomotor training in stroke rehabilitation. Static or dynamic~     balance deficits act crucial role on gait performance among stroke survivors. Therefore it is~     important to determine the effects of BWSTT in improving balance in persons with stroke.~     Although it has been demonstrated that BWSTT improved balance and gait performance in stroke~     patients, it is not clear whether the improvements are greater compared with those associated~     with other gait rehabilitation methods. To the investigators knowledge, there are also~     limited studies in the literature concerning the effects of BWSTT on falling risk in stroke~     patients. The strong evidence is needed about the effectiveness of BWSTT including~     comprehensive determinants of balance with combined and isolated intervention groups.This~     study aims to compare the effects of BWSTT with combined and isolated intervention on~     balance, gait and fall risk in patients with subacute and chronic stroke. The investigators~     hypotheses are that after stroke:~        1. the combination of BWSTT with conventional training may lead to more improved balance~          parameters;~        2. when applied as an isolated intervention, BWSTT or conventional training may lead to~          similar results.~   ",C0014653;C0038454,C0023866;C0376554;C0184511;C0184511;C0014653;C0014653;C0014653;C0014653;C0025663;C0014653;C0014653;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0085639;C0014653;C0014653;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C3834249;C0204601;C0204601;C0204601,0,0,-1,0,0,0.003042116,0.002095004,1,1,0.014093151

NCT01812993,Reversal of the Neurological Deficit in Acute Stroke With the Signal of Efficacy Trial of Auto BPAP to Limit Damage From Suspected Sleep Apnea,"~     Although the negative impact of sleep apnea on the clinical course of acute ischemic stroke~     (AIS) is well known, data regarding non-invasive ventilation in acute patients are scarce.~     Several studies showed its tolerability, safety and signals-of-efficacy, yet no controlled~     randomized sequential phase studies currently exist that aim to establish the efficacy of~     early non-invasive ventilation in AIS patients. The main hypothesis for this study is that~     early non-invasive ventilation with automated bilevel positive airway pressure (auto-BPAP)~     positively affects short-term clinical outcomes in AIS patients. This is a multicenter,~     prospective, randomized, controlled, third rater-blinded, parallel-group trial. Patients with~     AIS with proximal arterial obstruction and clinically suspected sleep apnea will be~     randomized to standard or standard stroke care plus auto-BPAP. Auto-BPAP will be initiated~     within 24 hours from stroke onset and performed for a maximum of 48 hours during diurnal and~     nocturnal sleep. Patients will undergo cardiorespiratory polygraphy between day 3 and 5 to~     assess sleep apnea. The primary endpoint is any early neurological improvement on the NIHSS~     at 72 hours from randomization. Safety, tolerability, short-term and 3 months functional~     outcomes are assessed as secondary endpoints by un-blinded and blinded observers~     respectively.

NCT00151177,Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation After Acute Ischemic Stroke,"~     More than half of all stroke patients have sleep apneas in the acute phase after stroke.~     Sleep apneas may be associated with higher degrees of disability three months after stroke~     due to numerous factors associated with sleep apneas such as persistent hypertension, cardiac~     arrhythmias, and clotting disorders.~      Non-invasive CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure)-therapy may reverse a number of these~     effects very shortly after initiation. The aim of the study is to test the feasibility of~     early non-invasive CPAP treatment starting in the first night after stroke onset, and to test~     its efficacy in a randomized clinical trial.~      50 patients with acute ischemic stroke will be enrolled and randomly assigned to standard~     care PLUS CPAP treatment or standard care only. All patients randomized to the intervention~     group will receive CPAP therapy for the first three nights after stroke. In the fourth night,~     a cardiorespiratory polygraphy will be performed in patients and controls. Patients assigned~     to the intervention group with a respiratory distress index > 10/h will be treated further~     on. On admission, day 4, and day 10 after stroke, diffusion weighted MRI imaging will be~     performed to determine the size of the infarction.

However, the chances to save the      brain tissue by a thrombolytic therapy exponentially decrease with proceeding time after      onset of symptoms.      In most cases, the beginning of the thrombolysis therapy is delayed by a variety of factors,      like delivery to the hospital, re-examinations and delay of blood analysis or of CT scans.

NCT02554487,Early Sleep Apnea Treatment in Stroke,"~     Investigating the interrelation of stroke and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is of major~     importance. First because of the high occurrence rate of stroke and the fact that it is a~     frequent cause of long-term disability in adulthood. Second because SDB (obstructive, central~     and mixed forms) affects more than 50% of stroke survivors and has a detrimental effect on~     clinical stroke outcome. Third, spontaneous and learning-dependent sleep-associated~     neuroplasticity may be affected by SDB following stroke worsening stroke rehabilitation.~     Therefore, it is crucial to investigate whether early treatment of SDB with Adaptive~     Servo-Ventilation (ASV), the treatment device of choice to treat obstructive, central and~     mixed forms of SDB, has a beneficial effect on the evolution of the lesion volume and on~     clinical stroke outcome.~      To this end, the investigators recruit and prospectively follow 3 groups of patients with~     ischemic stroke over 1 year. During the first night after hospital admission due to acute~     stroke, nocturnal breathing is assessed by means of a respiratory polygraphy. Patients with~     significant sleep disordered breathing, defined as an Apnea-Hypopnea-Index (AHI) > 20/h, are~     randomized to ASV treatment or no treatment (sSDB ASV+ or sSDB ASV-). ASV treatment starts~     the second night following hospital admission and ends 90 days later. Stroke patients without~     SDB (AHI < 5 / h) serve as a control group (no SDB) to observe the evolution of the lesion~     volume and stroke outcome without the additional burden of SDB.~      Lesion volume one day after hospital admission due to acute stroke (after potential lysis~     therapy) measured by Diffusion Weighted Imaging will be subtracted from lesion volume~     measured by T2-weighted volumetry assessed 90(+/-7) days following stroke and compared~     between patients with and without ASV treatment (sSDB ASV+ and sSDB ASV-) as well as patients~     without SDB (no SDB). Short- and long-term clinical stroke outcomes are assessed by clinical~     scales and questionnaires 4 to 7 days, 3 months and 1 year following stroke. Cognitive~     outcome is assessed during hospitalization (within the first week following stroke) and after~     the treatment period of 90 days by neuropsychological tests assessing attention and memory.~     In addition, baseline assessment of physiological parameters such as blood pressure and~     endothelial function/arterial stiffness are assessed during the first weeks following stroke~     and at the end of the treatment period, i.e. approximately 90 days following stroke.~   ",C0037315;C0038454;C0376495,C0598801;C0184666;C0184666;C0184666;C0948008;C0019993;C0034394;C0005823;C0004268;C0427008;C0023185;C0235546;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0221198;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0221198;C0038454;C0221198;C0038454;C0038454;C0222045;C0038454;C0038454;C0037313;C0037313;C0037313;C0003578;C0918012;C2948499;C2948499;C0221198;C0038454;C0024348;C2598130;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495,0,0,-1,0,0,0.002687132,0.001817903,0,3,0.012997566

NCT02006875,rTMS Study to Improve Functional Performance for Patients With Stroke,"To use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat stroke patients is      getting a popular idea. Previous studies seemed to support its effects on facilitating motor      recovery after stroke. This study focuses on the motor recovery of lower extremities.      Investigators conducted the study to evaluate the treatment effect of rTMS on the functional      performance of lower extremities in terms of postural control, balance, and mobility in      stroke patients. Investigators hypothesized that these performances could be improved through      the better motor control of lower extremities caused by rTMS.",C0038454;C0947630;C1550655;C0184511;C1705273,C0872259;C0023216;C0023216;C0023216;C1518681;C0425245;C0184511;C0947630;C0014653;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C0947630;C2004454;C2004454;C1518681;C0031843;C0220825,0,0,0,0,0,0.002539974,0.002986242,0,1,0.012941889
NCT01177748,Stroke Arrhythmia Monitoring Database,"Cardiac arrhythmia are frequently observed after stroke. They may on one hand be causative      for the stroke mainly in case of atrial fibrillation but on the other hand present severe      complications of the stroke. In addition, cardiac comorbidity as well as acute myocardial      infarction are frequently found in acute stroke patients. Diagnostics to identify cardiac      arrhythmia in the acute phase of stroke care thus have an important role not only for      adjusting the correct secondary prevention but also to prevent cardiac complications      potentially reducing morbidity and mortality.      The aim of the SAMBA-Study is to systematically assess the prevalence of higher grade      arrhythmias after stroke using a standardized reading of 72h telemetric monitoring in the      first days after stroke onset. In addition, it evaluates different strategies to identify      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.",C0003811;C0150369;C0242356;C0038454,C0235480;C0161816;C0679699;C0004238;C0003811;C0009566;C0751956;C0009488;C0003811;C0021308;C0003811;C0150369;C0679199;C0220880;C0150312;C0018787;C0018787;C0038454;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C3244287;C0018563;C0018563;C1704326;C0011900;C4084912;C3858576;C3858576;C0612923;C0155686,0,0,0,13,6.5,0.002098733,0.001831489,0,0,0.012928749
NCT03011762,Feasibility and Predictive Accuracy of an In-Home Computer Controlled Mandibular Positioner in Identifying Favorable Candidates for Oral Appliance Therapy,"~     Sleep apnea is a condition in which the throat air passage closes during sleep and repeatedly~     interrupts breathing. The standard treatment of sleep apnea is air pressure applied to the~     nose, so-called nasal CPAP, but it is not suitable for all patients. Another treatment is to~     use a dental appliance while asleep. In this treatment, an appliance covers the upper and~     lower teeth and acts to pull the jaw forward, which opens the throat passage. This allows the~     patient to breathe normally.~      Dental appliance treatment does not work effectively in all patients. In order to identify~     those in whom dental appliance therapy will be effective, the study sponsor has invented the~     remotely controlled mandibular positioner, MATRx. The MATRx is an FDA cleared motorized~     dental appliance which is used overnight in hospital sleep studies and works by pulling the~     jaw outward under the control of a technician.~      In order to eliminate the need for an overnight in hospital sleep study, the sponsor has~     invented a new device that allows for the identification of individuals who are suitable~     candidates for dental appliance therapy from the comfort of the home. Like with MATRx,~     participants will sleep with a motorized mandibular positioner in place. But, it is~     controlled by a computer, rather than a sleep technician, making it a computer controlled~     mandibular positioner (CCMP). The feasibility and predictive accuracy of multi night testing~     using the CCMP will be evaluated through participation in this study.~      The sponsor has carried out two previous research trials leading to the development of the~     CCMP. The first established the predictive accuracy of the remotely controlled mandibular~     positioner at identifying candidates suitable for oral appliance therapy and their effective~     therapeutic setting. The second established the accuracy of the algorithms used by the CCMP~     to similarly identify successful candidates in a clinical setting. No significant problems~     were identified in conjunction with our previous research protocol, and no significant risks~     were identified. This third protocol is to establish the feasibility and accuracy of the CCMP~     when used in the home setting.~      The trial will utilize data collected over a series of nights to formulate a prediction of~     therapeutic outcome with an oral appliance. The prediction will be tested by comparing the~     degree of airway obstruction without treatment (from data collected prior to the study) to~     the degree of airway obstruction with oral appliance therapy. A custom fit oral appliance~     will be provided to participants as part of the trial.~      The purpose of the study is to test the predictive accuracy of the CCMP in identifying~     favorable candidates for oral appliance therapy and in determining an efficacious protrusive~     position. Another purpose is to evaluate the convenience and possibility of carrying out a~     multi-night CCMP study in the home.~      There are no known risks or side effects to the CCMP studies, to the home studies, or to the~     oral appliance therapy. It is possible that participants will have some discomfort during the~     nights of the CCMP studies but this will be transient and not cause any long term damage.~     Participants may experience soreness of the teeth or jaw joint during adjustment of the oral~     appliance by the dentist. There is no risk of jaw dislocation or problems with the~     temporomandibular joint (TMJ).~      Participants will have the benefit of receiving a dental appliance for treating their sleep~     apnea at no charge. This will be supplied to participants by a dentist who is an expert in~     this field. Participation in the study will also allow the further development and ultimately~     commercialization of the CCMP device which may help individuals who have sleep apnea.~      Dental appliance therapy is just one of two therapies for sleep apnea. If participants choose~     not to have the dental appliance therapy, they may wish to try nasal continuous positive~     airway pressure. Participants may withdraw at any time during the study without compromising~     their health care in any way. To withdraw, participants should simply notify one of the~     physicians or the research assistant. If the sponsor obtains new information that might~     affect an individual's willingness to participate in the study, they will be informed~     immediately.~   ",C0180112,C0428719;C0020792;C4019276;C4019276;C0037315;C0037315;C0028778;C0028778;C0037315;C0596545;C0332149;C2584320;C1331418;C3665375;C0424522;C3665375;C0037313;C0040426;C0037313;C0037313;C0037313;C0037313;C0040426;C0003578;C0037313;C0028429;C3536832;C3536832;C0022359;C0022359;C0022359;C0022359;C0012691;C0002045;C1446409;C0424092;C0424092;C0033213;C0600091;C0600091;C1269048;C3810854;C0037313;C0033213;C0180112;C0180112;C0180112;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495,0,0,-1,4,4,0.002246181,0.000706984,0,3,0.0129196

However, the beneficial effect of surgery in patients with symptomatic 30-69%      stenosis is not clear yet.A clear beneficial effect of surgery in the 30-69% stenosis group      might be found in a sub-group of patients whom are at greater risk for stroke. Definition of      this sub-group might be achieved by plaque characterization, since rupture of a vulnerable      plaque is the main cause of stroke due to carotid artery stenosis.This study will include      patients with a 30-69% carotid artery stenosis, and assess plaque composition by MRI, the      degree of plaque inflammation by FDG-PET, and the amount of microembolization by transcranial      Doppler ultrasound.

NCT01548781,The Effect of Resistance to Participant-Supported Reaching on Workspace of the Hand in Severe Chronic Stroke,"Disturbances in movement coordination are the least well understood but often the most      debilitating with respect to functional recovery following stroke. These deficits in      coordination are expressed in the form of abnormal muscle synergies and result in limited and      stereotypic movement patterns that are functionally disabling. The result of these      constraints in muscle synergies is an abnormal coupling between shoulder abduction and elbow      flexion (i.e. the flexion synergy), which significantly reduces the reaching function of an      individual with stroke when they lift up the weight of the impaired arm against gravity. The      investigators previous neurotherapeutic research, supported by a NIDRR Field Initiated      research grant, has shown that the abnormal synergy between shoulder abduction and elbow      flexion can be significantly reduced thus increasing total reaching range of motion in      individuals with severe stroke. The previous work established progressive abduction loading      as a key element to the rehabilitation of reaching. Although individuals with severe stroke      benefited from the investigators previous work, residual flexion synergy continued to hinder      normal arm function in most participants with severe stroke. This study will utilize the      ACT3D robot, developed as part of the investigators previous NIDRR project, to incorporate      resistance to reaching while accounting for the known benefits of progressive abduction      loading. The investigators propose to randomize forty participants with severe stroke into      two closely related interventions. The groups will both practice reaching under abduction      loading, however, the experimental group will also move against resistance while reaching.      Rigorous and quantitative investigation of therapeutic elements such as resistance to      reaching and progressive abduction loading is only possible with a device such as the ACT3D.      the investigators will be able to standardize the delivery of each intervention using      kinematic and kinetic parameters, which will allow for a clear identification of the      therapeutic effect of resistance to reaching. the investigators hypothesize that resistance      to reaching in combination with progressive abduction loading will further increase dynamic      multi-joint strength, increase total reaching range of motion, and increase arm function thus      enhancing actual amount of use of the arm, participation in life roles, and quality of life      in individuals with severe stroke.",C0237834;C2584321;C1547296;C0205082;C0038454;C0018563;C3165543;C1171411,C0599766;C0427096;C0080078;C0080078;C0518214;C0034991;C0886296;C1552578;C0184661;C0231456;C0231456;C0231456;C0231456;C0231456;C0231456;C0231456;C0205161;C0205161;C0037004;C0031843;C0205161;C0037004;C0031843;C0237607;C0332149;C0011209;C0031843;C0038454;C0038454;C1305866;C0205082;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C1553386;C0205082;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C1552839;C1518681;C0205082;C0038454;C0013769;C0013769;C0947630;C0181620;C0560560;C1299581;C0446516;C0446516;C0446516;C0446516;C0087111;C0087111;C3539181;C0020792;C0520966;C0520966;C0233492;C0162340;C0237834;C0237834;C0237834;C0237834;C0237834;C3839460;C3839460;C3839460;C3839460;C2363670;C1880258;C0449878;C1552839;C1254223;C0404831;C0038272;C0221106;C0026649;C1548344;C1548344;C1548344;C1548344;C1548344;C1548344;C4086497;C1548344;C1548344;C1548344;C1548344;C3834249;C1525443;C1525443;C1525443;C0007009;C1525443;C1444662,0,0,0,3,3,0.002008555,0.002663052,1,3,0.012257135

NCT01372059,The Effects of a Rhythm and Music-based Therapy Program and Therapeutic Riding in Late Recovery Phase Following Stroke,"The initiative to the study is based on the fact that various forms of enriched environments      and multimodal stimulation are found to have positive influences on motivation and      psychosocial well-being and have been shown to facilitate multiple processes in the brain      leading to structural regeneration and functional recovery. Since there is a lack of      rehabilitation programs that encompass all dimensions of a stroke survivor's life researchers      agree upon the need for a rehabilitation program that addresses both the social and physical      needs of the patients. The aim with the project is to investigate whether it is possible to      improve the life situation among patients with a history of stroke through a rhythm and music      method and therapeutic riding. To get insights in the underlying mechanisms our research also      focuses on relevant physiological, neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms induced by the      interventions. The hypothesis is that both treatment methods will mainly enhance      participants' degree of participation.      The study is a randomized controlled trial where about 123 participants (50-75 years old) who      had their stroke incident 1 - 5 years ago will be consecutively included and randomly      allocated to the following three groups: a) Ronnie Gardiner Rhythm Music Method (RGRM) b)      therapeutic riding c) a control group receiving RGRM after 9 months. Treatment proceeds      during 12 weeks and evaluation takes place pre- and post intervention, and 12 and 24 weeks      after the treatment is finalized. The evaluation consists of a thorough neuropsychological      assessment, a physiotherapeutic assessment, sampling of blood and questionnaires covering      mental, psychosocial, physical and psychological well-being. Interviews are also conducted in      order to map the participants' experiences from the two treatment programs. Specially      designed interviews are also planned to be carried through with participants having aphasia.

NCT00561405,A Comparison of Two Intensive Walking Training Interventions in Community Dwelling Individuals With History of Stroke,"Stroke is a major cause of disability in Canadian adults. Following a stroke, many people      have difficulty walking in their home and in the community. The purpose of this study is to      compare the effect of two different approaches to walking retraining in people who have had a      stroke.      Individuals living in the community who have had recently had a stroke will be asked to      participate in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two five week      walking training programs. In one program, individuals will re-learn to walk in a variety of      real-life situations. Practice sessions will encourage active problem solving by the      participants. The other program will have participants practice walking on a treadmill while      some of their body weight is supported by a special harness system. Participants will also be      assisted by a physiotherapist to walk in a more normal manner.      Participants' will be assessed at the beginning of the study, after the 5 week training      program and again, eight weeks later. The research assistant will assess their ability to      walk, their confidence level and the average daily walking activity.      Primary Hypothesis: Individuals assigned to the Motor Learning Walking Program will improve      their walking ability from baseline to follow up assessment significantly more than      individuals assigned to the Treadmill Training Program.      The results of this study will help physiotherapists plan effective treatment programs for      individuals with walking difficulties following stroke. It will also give researchers      direction for future studies in the areas of walking retraining and motor skill development      post-stroke.",C1273869;C1554161;C4283795;C0262926;C0038454;C0882214;C0038999,C0311394;C0033211;C1299586;C1305866;C0026612;C0243107;C0231170;C0237529;C0031809;C0087111;C1552601;C0237607;C1552601;C0023185;C1552601;C1554161;C4283795;C0376691;C0376691;C0947630;C0038454;C0038454;C1518681;C0038454;C0038454;C1553386;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C0947630;C0023185;C0947630;C0947630;C1561540;C1561540;C1552861;C0442694;C0442694;C0184511;C1320102;C0233697;C0949766;C0870365;C0042070;C0237607;C4049938;C0728774;C0042070;C0701928,0,0,1,2,2,0.002030056,0.002371672,0,3,0.011828237

NCT02539381,The Stroke Vision App: A Screening Tool for Visual Stroke,"Visual impairment can affect up to 70% of stroke survivors, but many do not have their vision      adequately assessed in hospital. An unidentified visual defect can cause significant problems      for recovery and quality of life. The Stroke Vision app (an application currently scaled for      a 10"" Android tablet) has been developed to act as a screening tool for visual problems in      stroke survivors; to help identify visual problems earlier and thereby improve rehabilitation      outcomes. The app includes a suite of tests for assessing the patient's acuity, their visual      fields and to aid in the identification of visual neglect / inattention. Furthermore, it      includes educational information on visual stroke in order to better educate staff, patients      and their carers. This study seeks to validate the novel digital assessments included in the      Stroke Vision app against the current methods used for screening (clinical examination by      confrontation field testing).

NCT00850408,Enhancing the Response to Rehabilitation After Stroke Using Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS),"Weakness of the arm and hand results in long-term disability for many persons who suffer a      stroke. After the initial recovery phase, only limited gains are achieved by retraining the      weak limb to perform daily tasks. However, new treatment strategies such as repetitive      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) show promise for enhancing motor recovery after      stroke. rTMS is a noninvasive technique for modifying brain activity that aims to improve      motor function by correcting abnormal patterns that occur after stroke. We believe that      giving rTMS right before a therapy session will prepare the brain so that the patient is      better able to participate in and benefit from training of the hand and arm. The goal of this      study is to test how well this new strategy works to improve recovery in people who have mild      to moderate weakness of the arm and hand after stroke.      Participants will receive magnetic stimulation of the movement area of the brain just prior      to arm and hand training for a series of eight sessions. We will evaluate changes in hand and      arm function after the intervention and one month later to see if the changes are maintained.      We will also test whether some groups of people benefit more than others from the      intervention. If improvements in hand and arm function are observed after the intervention,      we will test it more rigourously in a future clinical trial in which participants are      randomly assigned to different treatment conditions.

NCT01751854,Enhanced Motor Recovery Using Serotonergic Agents in Stroke,"The information derived from this study will be critical to establishing appropriate      rehabilitative interventions post-stroke. In particular, traditional use of pharmacological      agents to alter motor function post-stroke is directed primarily at reducing the ""positive""      signs following upper motor neuron lesion, in particular spasticity, or enhanced,      velocity-dependent stretch reflex responses to imposed stretch. While pharmacological      management of spasticity certainly suppresses clinical and quantitative measures of      hypertonia, there is little improvement in functional performance. In contrast, preliminary      data on the administration of 5HT agents following neurological injury indicates an increase      in motor performance (Pariente 2001) and recovery (Dam 1996), despite an increase in spastic      motor activity (Stolp-Smith 1999; see Preliminary Data below). Understanding methods to      maximize function following stroke despite potential, short-term increases in spastic motor      activity may improve therapeutic intervention strategies. The general objective of this study      is therefore to:        1. quantify the effects of short-term SSRI administration on voluntary and spastic motor           behaviors in individuals with chronic spastic hemiparesis,        2. identify the changes in impairments and functional recovery of walking ability during           BWSTT with the presence or absence of SSRIs.",C0242701;C2004454;C0038454,C0235834;C0087111;C0751792;C0599766;C0870921;C4505218;C0034991;C1533734;C1533734;C0886296;C0162340;C0018989;C0026838;C0376636;C0026838;C0026826;C0679199;C0429964;C0018017;C0677505;C0031843;C1446409;C0031843;C0392148;C0600080;C0600080;C0443306;C0025663;C0443306;C0443306;C0443306;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C0947630;C0360105;C3245479;C0042789;C0684336;C1704632;C2004454;C0184511;C0424530;C3242430;C1518681;C3844714;C1716046;C0031843;C3543419;C0449900;C3858576;C0441229;C1547298;C4522152;C3272565;C4049938;C4049938,0,0,0,1,1,0.002405737,0.002664178,0,1,0.010923581
NCT01774669,Effectiveness Study on a Virtual Reality Based Training System for Stroke Patients,"The patient study is a phase III trial designed as a single-blinded, randomised, controlled      multi-centre trial with repeated measurement events (ME).

Figure 1 illustrates the study overview.      The study focuses on the evaluation of the YouGrabber efficacy compared to conventional      therapy in an outpatient setting.      Research question: Do patients after stroke in the YouGrabber training group show higher      postintervention performance in the Box and Block Test (BBT) compared to patients in the      conventional therapy group? Hypothesis: H0: The investigators hypothesise that there will be      no group differences after 16 training sessions or after the two month follow-up period.      H1: The investigators hypothesise that there will be a group difference after the 16 training      sessions and after the two month follow-up period.      Aim: The aim of the project is to design and implement a single-blinded, randomised      controlled multi-centre trial comparing YouGrabber training and conventional therapy in      patients after stroke.      Patients will be randomly allocated to either the experimental group (EG) or the control      group (CG) after the second ME (T0). Group allocation will be based on a computer-generated      randomisation list (one for each centre, (MATLAB, 2007b, Mathworks Inc., USA) created by a      researcher not involved into the study. Randomisation lists and corresponding token will be      stored in the clinics' pharmacy. Patients will draw a token before the first therapy session.      The token will be marked and stored until study finalisation in the pharmacy.      Group allocation will remain concealed for the independent assessor until study finalisation.      Patients and treating therapists will be reminded not to talk about patient's group      allocation with other therapists or participants.      Patients in both study groups (EG, CG) will receive the same amount of 16 sessions lasting      for 45 minutes each. During each therapy appointment patients can decide to stop the training      at any time.      Patients allocated to EG will have the opportunity to participate in two semi-structured      interviews to evaluate their expectations and experiences with the virtual reality therapy      with YouGrabber.

NCT02310438,Music Therapy for The Rehabilitation of Upper Limb With Stroke Patients,"Impairment of arm function is more common than lower limb impairment in stroke patients and      is also more resistant to treatment. Several clinical trials with stroke patients have      produced statistically significant gains in upper limb function when using instrumental      playing and treatments where rhythm supports the priming and timing of movements. Based on      the positive results from controlled and non-controlled trials, the Cochrane review of music      therapy for acquired brain injury (Bradt, et al., 2010) recommends further investigation into      rhythm based techniques to treat hemiparesis in stroke patients, and that future studies need      to examine the relationship between the frequency and duration of interventions and treatment      effects.      The aim of this study is to examine whether or not a thirty minute, twice weekly, six week,      home music therapy treatment, playing set musical patterns on instruments to music is      feasible to deliver, and will lead to improved coordination, dexterity and activities of      daily living in hemiparetic stroke patients.      Twelve patients will be recruited from Cambridgeshire Community Services NHS trust (CCS) who      are between one month and two years post stroke with hemiparesis.

NCT01006434,Weight Approximation in Stroke Before Thrombolysis,"Thrombolysis using Alteplase (tPA) is still the only approved specific therapy for acute      ischemic stroke (AIS). Current guidelines in western countries recommend an tPA dose of      0.9mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 90mg for patients weighing more than 100kg. However, larger      dose-finding rtPA trials for intravenous thrombolysis in AIS are missing. Based on results      from research on myocardial infarction only a few open label studies with low case rates were      initiated to evaluate the optimal dose for tPA in cerebral ischemia. These studies suggested      a narrow therapeutic range with decreased efficacy in lower dosages and an increased risk for      thrombolysis related intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at doses above 0.95mg/kg. The ECASS-1      trial which used a dosage of 1.1mg/kg rt-PA showed significantly higher rate of large      parenchymal hemorrhages compared to trials using 0.9mg/kg. Therefore accurate dosing is      crucial. In the acute phase two aspects complicate rtPA dosing in AIS: First, unlike in other      diseases many stroke patients are unable to communicate information on their body weight (BW)      because of their stroke symptoms (e.g. aphasia, decreased consciousness). In addition motor      symptoms prohibit easy weighing procedures in many patients. Second, the ultra-early and      narrow time window for treatment does not allow time loss to weigh each patient in the      emergency situation. Therefore routinely the attending physician has to make a visual      estimation of the patient's BW. This may be inaccurate and may cause dosing errors which has      been shown for other weight based emergency medication. There is little data on tPA-dosing      errors in stroke patients and prospective data are lacking. The aim of our study is to      evaluate availability of BW-information, accuracy of estimations and final dosing of tPA in a      routine clinical setting. Therefore the investigators evaluate different sources of body      weight estimations and also compare visual estimation with recently proposed anthropometric      measurements for body weight approximation.

NCT00926874,Comparative Study of Arterial Properties After an Ischaemic Stroke or an Acute Coronary Syndrome,"A pilot, prospective, comparative study. To include both male and female patients who have      presented an ischaemic stroke (full stroke or TIA) or an ACS, 5 to 30 days prior to      inclusion.      The proposed study aims to investigate and analyse the differences in functional and      structural arterial properties between the patients who presented an ischaemic stroke and      those who presented ACS. The hypothesis is that the patients in both groups will present      differences partly in terms of their ""traditional"" cardiovascular risk factors, but also in      terms of their arterial properties. All of the confounding factors studied (cardiovascular      risk factors, treatments) will be taken into account in order to explain the differences in      the arterial properties found between the two groups.

NCT04048291,Efficacy of Brisk Walking in Parkinson's Disease,"~     Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neuro-degenerative disease in older~     people. Falls are common among people PD with the incidence rate up to 70% and have strong~     associations with the severity of the disease, balance impairment, and freezing of gait.The~     abnormal gait characteristics include reduction in stride length, gait speed and arm swing,~     and increase in cadence. Gait training, balance training, aerobic training, Tai chi and dance~     training are common types of physical rehabilitation for PD. Brisk walking is a way of~     walking with a pace faster than normal, and it can improve dynamic balance for senior men and~     balance function for chronic stroke clients.~      Brisk walking also promotes cardiopulmonary fitness and walking endurance in elderly women,~     healthy middle-age and older adults, active elderly men and chronic stroke clients. Our~     previous pilot randomized controlled trial on the effects of a 6-week home-based brisk~     walking program indicates that it is feasible and safe for the early PD population with~     improved walking capacity measured by 6-minute walk distance. The positive effects could~     carry over to 6 weeks after treatment completion. Up-to-date, the short- and long-term~     effects of brisk walking in improving balance and gait performance, and functional capacity~     in people with PD have not yet been well investigated. In order to promote their balance and~     functional capacity in longer term, more sustained training and better exercise adherence may~     be necessary.~   ",C0012634,C1998319;C0553534;C0004083;C0518031;C0205161;C0184511;C1446409;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C0014653;C0014653;C0014653;C0014653;C2728259;C0014653;C0014653;C0038454;C0038454;C0085639;C0446516;C1998319;C0184511;C1320102;C2732140;C0282440;C0204601;C0376495,0,0,-1,0,0,0.000960936,0.002185676,0,1,0.010547065

NCT01763320,China Angioplasty & Stenting for Symptomatic Intracranial Severe Stenosis,"~     Patients with symptomatic stenosis of intradural arteries are at high risk for subsequent~     stroke. Since the SAMMPRIS trial, stenting is no longer recommended as primary treatment,~     however, the results of this trial, its inclusion criteria and its center selection received~     significant criticism and did not appear to reflect our experience, neither regarding natural~     history, nor treatment complications rate. As ICAS is the most common cause for stroke in~     Asian countries, we are hereby proposing a refined prospective randomized multicenter study~     in an Asian population with strictly defined patient and participating center inclusion~     criteria.~      The China Angioplasty & Stenting for Symptomatic Intracranial Severe Stenosis (CASSISS)~     trial, is an ongoing, government-funded, prospective, multicenter randomized trial. It~     recruits patients with recent TIA or stroke caused by 70-99% stenosis of a major intracranial~     artery. Patients with previous stroke related to perforator ischemia will not be included.~     Only high-volume center with a proven track record will enroll patients as determined by a~     lead-in phase. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to best medical therapy alone or medical~     therapy plus stenting. Primary endpoints are any stroke or death within 30 days after~     enrollment or after any revascularization procedure of the qualifying lesion during~     follow-up, or stroke in the territory of the symptomatic intracranial artery beyond 30 days~     The CASSISS trial will be conducted in 8 sites in China with core imaging lab review at a~     North American site and aims to have a sample size of 380 subjects (stenting, 190; medical~     therapy, 190). Recruitment is expected to be finished by Dec, 2016. Patients will be followed~     for at least three years. The trial is scheduled to complete in 2019. In the proposed trial,~     certain shortcomings of SAMMPRIS including patient and participating center selection will be~     addressed. The present manuscript outlines the rationale and design of the study. We estimate~     that this trial will allow for a critical reappraisal of the role of intracranial stenting~     for selected patients in high volume centers.~   ",C0524466;C0162577;C2348535;C1261287,C0418981;C0524466;C0524466;C0524466;C0162577;C0596545;C1516879;C1261287;C0003842;C2348535;C2348535;C1261287;C1261287;C0022116;C2348535;C2348535;C0150312;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0221198;C0038454;C0009566;C0524466;C0600659;C2348535;C0034869;C0204742;C1449882;C0027686;C1442065;C1330542;C0332167;C0376495,0,0,-1,0,0,0.000873014,0.001596185,0,2,0.010476491

NCT00958607,Optimizing Stroke Family Caregiver Support Across the Care Continuum by Improving the Timing of Intervention Delivery,"About 50% of stroke survivors have limitations in their activities of daily living on return      to the community. Family caregivers provide invaluable support to these individuals during      their recovery and rehabilitation. Unfortunately, there is no standard clinical practice to      prepare caregivers for this role and, as a result, many experience stress and poor health      that can compromise stroke survivor recovery and threaten the sustainability of the care      needed to thrive in their home. To address this gap, the investigators have developed the      Timing it Right Stroke Family Support Program that aims to meet the evolving needs of      caregivers. The objective of this multi-province randomized controlled trial is to determine      if this program delivered across the stroke care continuum improves caregivers' sense of      being supported and emotional well-being.

NCT01858779,Know Your Pulse Post Stroke-Measurement of Peripheral Pulse for Detection of Atrial Fibrillation After Ischemic Stroke,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cause of cardioembolism and a leading cause of      ischemic stroke. The diagnosis of AF after cerebral ischemia is difficult to establish even      during the treatment at specialised stroke units, as paroxysmal episodes may terminate      spontaneously before arrival at the hospital and do not always show early recurrence.      However, the diagnosis of AF is of particular clinical relevance since adaequate      anticoagulation is one of the most effective secondary preventive treatments in stroke. The      detection rate of AF after stroke increases progressively by extending the duration and      intensity of cardiac monitoring. For this purpose innovative medical devices and implantable      event recorders have been suggested. However, high socioeconomic expenses, malcompliance and      the invasiveness of some of these approaches currently limit their use to a minority of      affected patients, while the growing number of stroke survivors is lacking access to free and      simple screening tools.      For primary prevention, the measurement of the peripheral pulse (MPP) is currently the only      guideline-recommended screening method among individuals aged 65 years or older. In contrast,      MPP has never been applied in the setting of secondary stroke prevention, probably because      several factors were expected to interfere with this simple technique, including sensomotor      and neuropsychiologic handicaps of stroke patients 18. This study investigates feasibility      and validity of MPP in this cohort (pilot phase) and compares daily MPP for 6 months with      repeated holter-ECG in patients after ischemic stroke.",C0004238;C0948008;C1511790;C0038454;C0034107;C0034107;C3843236,C0004238;C0150496;C0033144;C0917798;C1277289;C0948008;C0003281;C0025080;C0948008;C1458156;C0087111;C0011900;C0332218;C0087111;C0011900;C0027627;C0182913;C0199230;C0282423;C0199230;C0027627;C0231172;C0332148;C0542559;C3245511;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0025663;C0038454;C0034107;C0947630;C3843802;C1553407;C0021102;C0723323;C0723323;C0202165;C1511790;C0332534;C0449900;C4055646;C1561542;C0015733;C3272565,0,0,1,1,1,0.002702837,0.002230759,0,3,0.009066594

Pilot studies with stroke patients indicate that the application of Nintendo      Wii? (WII) is practicable and can improve balance under clinical conditions. However, larger      trials are necessary to verify these positive effects after discharge from the hospital.      AIM: This study aims to prepare and optimize a phase III trial which compares the effects of      two HBE programs for stroke patients.      METHODS: A pilot study with randomized control design and repeated measures over three-months      will be conducted. Twenty elderly stroke patients will be randomly allocated to an      experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). All participants will receive an      introduction to a HBE program by an individual mentoring over 6 weeks. During the following 6      weeks the participants perform the HBE on their own.

NCT01907321,Cough and Swallow Rehab Following Stroke,"Stroke is the leading case of neurologic swallow dysfunction, or dysphagia. Post stroke      dysphagia is associated with approximately 50% increase in the rate of pneumonia diagnoses;      aspiration pneumonia is the most common respiratory complication in all stroke deaths,      accounting for a three-fold increase in the 30-day post stroke death rate. The long-term goal      of this systematic line of research is to decrease the morbidity, mortality, and health care      costs associated with disordered airway protection following stroke.      The overall hypothesis central to this proposal is that the ability to protect the airway is      dependent upon a continuum of multiple behaviors, including swallowing and cough. Safe,      efficient swallowing prevents material from entering the larynx and lower airway, and      effective cough ejects aspirate or mucus material. Currently, only one end of the continuum,      swallowing, is rigorously assessed in stroke patients. However, ineffective or disordered      cough is indicative of the inability to eject aspirate material or clear mucus and secretions      from the lower airway. Ineffective clearance and subsequent accumulation of material in the      lower airway increases the risk of chest infection. Hence, patients at the greatest risk for      chest infection would not only have disordered swallowing (dysphagia) but also disordered      cough (dystussia), meaning they are more likely to aspirate material and then cannot      effectively eject the aspirate from the airway. There is a high likelihood that swallowing      and cough are simultaneously disordered following stroke. To date, there is a treatment that      targets both swallowing and cough function in stroke patients.      Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) increases expiratory muscle strength (Baker et      al., 2005) and there is evidence that supports its use to improve both swallow and cough      functions in patients with Parkinson's disease (Troche et al., in press). This cross-system,      device-driven approach to rehabilitating multiple contributors to airway protection deficits      is highly desirable in the stroke population due to the likelihood of the co-occurrence of      both swallow and cough disorders. To date, EMST has not been tested in stroke patients. We      propose that by including cough in the screening, evaluation and treatment processes for      disorders of airway protection, we will be able to better identify and treat patients most at      risk for airway compromise and associated sequelae.",C0038454;C0010200;C0034991,C0161818;C0032290;C0030567;C0872279;C0238990;C0238990;C0277785;C0086388;C0011167;C0011167;C0011167;C0036537;C0011167;C0011167;C0011167;C0231800;C0220825;C2945640;C0011168;C0011168;C0032285;C0011900;C0220880;C0429964;C0677505;C0011168;C0087111;C0012634;C0199230;C0087111;C0012634;C1948033;C0370199;C0370199;C0370199;C0370199;C0031843;C0243088;C0038454;C0038454;C3245511;C0038454;C0011065;C0038454;C0178987;C0038454;C0178987;C0023078;C0178987;C0038454;C0178987;C0178987;C0332148;C0178987;C0038454;C0038454;C0178987;C0038454;C0392366;C0038454;C0178987;C0178987;C0011065;C0010200;C0010200;C0026727;C0010200;C0026727;C0010200;C0010200;C0010200;C0010200;C0010200;C0010200;C0018017;C1299581;C4050373;C0031843;C0442797;C0935444;C0740170;C0184511;C0740170;C0740170;C4055506;C3842841;C1545588;C0231800;C1545588;C1545588;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C1382187;C3858576;C0013126;C1328018;C0034991,0,28,1,4,4,0.002428616,0.002239678,0,1,0.008586377
NCT01962662,Intervention Study of EMG Biofeedback Assisted Force Control to Treat Stroke Movement Disorder,"Force generation and force level control are important neuromuscular control mechanism for      successful execution of movement for our daily activities. Impaired force level control is a      major deficit of motor control in people with stroke. Electromyographic biofeedback (EMG      biofeedback) has been suggested by researchers and clinicians to be a useful and effective      tool for enhancing control of force level during motor skill learning for people with stroke.      Based on the concept of motor-skill learning, practice with variable force levels may be more      effective than practice with a constant force level to enhance movement performance. The EMG      biofeedback provides a suitable tool for such practice of force level control and hence for      motor skill learning. However, research literatures thus far have yet to provide convincing      evidences to support this claim. Neural imaging studies have shown corresponding brain      reorganization and neural plasticity following physical practice of movement skills in people      with stroke. It is curious whether EMG biofeedback augmented physical practice of motor      skills enhances brain reorganization. Using brain mapping techniques, in particular, the      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we could investigate neural plasticity accompanying      motor function changes induced by physical training, and hence may help to develop safer and      more effective training parameters. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of      variable practiced EMG biofeedback training emphasized on force level control of the ankle      muscle on balance and gait performance and the corresponding changes of corticospinal      excitability using TMS in people with chronic stroke.",C1096775;C0026650;C0005491;C0038454;C0016533;C1564718,C0436548;C0871664;C0871370;C0871370;C0871370;C0006117;C0235169;C0005491;C0005491;C0005491;C0005491;C0237607;C0237607;C0237607;C0237607;C0237607;C0031843;C0079595;C0947630;C0014653;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0006104;C0006104;C0947630;C0003086;C1552861;C0016928;C0436548;C0436548;C0023866;C1550470;C0237607;C0442694;C0442694;C1555587;C0000589;C0013839;C0011164;C1518681;C1831583;C1831583;C4084912;C0016533;C0016533;C0016533;C0016533;C0016533;C0016533;C0016533;C0016533;C0026649;C4553760;C0026649;C1555587;C0031809;C0026649;C0031809;C0031809;C4553760;C2363670,0,0,1,0,0,0.001885162,0.002255984,0,1,0.008582311

NCT01413321,Assessing Special Features of Impaired Gait After Acquired Brain Injury With an Instrumented Treadmill,"~     Hemiparetic gait following acquired brain injury (ABI) is grossly characterized by decreased~     speed of walking, increased stance time on the unaffected side, and decreased stance time on~     the affected side.These abnormalities are associated with a complex pattern of dysfunction~     including muscle weakness, spasticity, impaired sensory-motor control, long-term mechanical~     changes in muscles and joints, and cognitive impairments e.g. attention.\ At this stage of~     our knowledge it is still unclear which kinetic and kinematic parameters of hemiparetic gait~     provide insight about the different components of the complex pattern of dysfunction.~      A novel technique had been introduced in the Motion Laboratory of the Sheba Medical Center~     consisting of an ordinary treadmill that is equipped with a 'mat' of more than 5000~     high-quality capacitive pressure/force sensors. This treadmill developed by ZEBRIS enables~     to analyze gait and roll-off patterns on the treadmill.~      Aims of the study:~        1. To assess variability of data derived from the Zebris treadmill.~        2. To investigate stability of hemiparetic gait.~        3. To evaluate variability and relevant gait parameters taking place during recovery after~          acute ABI.~        4. To compare gait on ground with gait on treadmill.~      Rationale of the study- Basic assumptions of the study:~        1. No significant change in gait parameters is expected in both groups including healthy~          controls and chronic ABI subjects in recurrent examination within one week period.~        2. Subacute ABI patients are found to be within the context of neurorehabilitative recovery~          due to brain plasticity. Therefore a change in gait parameters is expected within two~          consecutive examinations in the chosen time intervals.~        3. All measurements are subject to error which contributes to the variance of outcomes.~      On the grounds of these assumptions:~      A. Two consecutive examinations in both groups including healthy controls and chronic ABI~     subjects are intended to estimate the error in measured values.~      B. Two consecutive examinations in the subacute ABI patient group are intended to estimate~     the contribution of neurorehabilitative recovery due to brain plasticity assessed with this~     unique research instrumentation.~   ",C0006104,C0151786;C0376554;C2004454;C2004454;C0233820;C0006104;C0441722;C0006104;C0006104;C2004454;C1330542;C0004268;C1444783;C1330542;C0939261;C0939261,0,0,-1,0,0,0.000519109,0.000726072,0,0,0.008086934

NCT00729625,Air Muscle and Task Practice in Upper Limb Stroke Rehab,"Many patients who have sustained strokes are unable to effectively use their hemiparetic      upper extremity. Limited mobility in the performance of daily activities, such as eating or      dressing, adversely affects their quality of life and compromises independence.      Rehabilitation techniques engaging the hemiparetic limb in repetitive task practice (RTP) may      improve upper extremity function and quality of life in patients with stroke, but costs limit      the number of patients that can utilize this type of therapy. Advances in microprocessor      design and function make the use of an assistive device as an adjunct to RTP plausible. An      innovative assistive repetitive motion (ARM) device using an ""air muscle"" has been developed      specifically for the rehabilitation of the hemiparetic upper extremity. The primary aim of      the proposed study is to collect pilot data to estimate the clinical effectiveness of using      the ARM device in conjunction with RTP to improve upper extremity motor function and the      quality of life of patients with stroke. Twenty sub-acute (3 to 9 mos. post-stoke) patients      will be randomized to a RTP only or ARM + RTP group. The RTP group will receive 15 days (4      hours per day) of intensive one-on-one RTP therapy. The ARM + RTP group will use the ARM      device for 2 hours per day and receive 2 hours of intensive RTP per day for 15 days. Clinical      motor function and quality of life measures will be taken before and after the interventions      and two months later. We hypothesize that the ARM + RTP group will exhibit greater      improvements in motor function and quality of life measures than the RTP only group.",C1140618;C4083049;C0038454;C0034991;C3536832;C0237607,C0700572;C0036605;C1140618;C0518214;C1140618;C0518214;C1140618;C1140618;C0518214;C0518214;C0518214;C0034991;C0034991;C4553491;C0886296;C2945640;C0013119;C0425152;C0237607;C0031843;C0031843;C0031843;C3272565;C0031843;C0031843;C0038454;C0087111;C0087111;C0015272;C0566415;C0013470;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C0015385;C3245479;C0446516;C0446516;C0026987;C0446516;C1561538;C0446516;C0446516;C1561538;C1561538;C0446516;C0439857;C2360800;C0725066;C0184511;C0184511;C0001721;C0013987;C2363670;C1561542;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C0185414;C3272565;C0034770,0,0,0,24,24,0.002089753,0.002556756,0,1,0.007300569

NCT02270398,Dual-task Training in Chronic Stroke,"Background Functional community ambulation not only requires a critical level of postural      control and walking skills, but also the ability to engage in cognitive tasks while walking      (i.e., dual-task walking) and adapt to the constantly-changing environmental contexts. There      is evidence showed that dual-task balance and gait performance is significantly impaired      after stroke. Increasing evidence also suggests that dual-task balance and gait performance      is useful for predicting falls among individuals with stroke. Considering the high clinical      relevance of dual-task balance and gait performance, it is essential that stroke      rehabilitation adequately addresses dual-task deficits. Developing specific dual-task balance      and gait training to enhance dual-task performance is thus necessary to promote community      ambulation and reintegration.      Study Aim The aim of this Introduction Many individuals after stroke continue to cope with      residual physical impairments after discharge from hospital. One of the major problems      encountered by people after stroke is community reintegration. Functional community      ambulation not only requires a critical level of postural control and walking skills, but      also the ability to engage in cognitive tasks while walking (i.e., dual-task walking) and      adapt to the constantly-changing environmental contexts. There has been an increasing      awareness of the importance of dual-task gait performance in community-dwelling individuals      with stroke in the past few years.      There is evidence showed that dual-task balance and gait performance is significantly      impaired after stroke. Increasing evidence also suggests that dual-task balance and gait      performance is useful for predicting falls among individuals with stroke. Considering the      high clinical relevance of dual-task balance and gait performance, it is essential that      stroke rehabilitation adequately addresses dual-task deficits. Developing specific dual-task      balance and gait training to enhance dual-task performance is thus necessary to promote      community ambulation and reintegration.

NCT01709045,ParisK: Correlation of Imaging Techniques With Histology,"~     The possibility to identify the risk of rupture of a carotid plaque will have tremendous~     impact in clinical decision making. A vulnerable plaque is considered to have a large lipid~     rich necrotic core (LRNC), a thin fibrous cap, the presence of inflammatory cells,~     intraplaque haemorrhage and/or neovascularisation (vasa vasorum). The investigators aim to~     validate imaging of plaque vulnerability with histology. Previous studies have evaluated the~     use of imaging to assess carotid plaque vulnerability, mostly showing a good correlation~     between imaging and histology and/or clinical characteristics. However, they have focused on~     single modalities, (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], multidetector-row computed tomography~     (MDCT), ultrasonography (US) or transcranial Doppler (TCD), and have used relatively small~     cohorts~      The primary goal of this study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between~     neovascularisation in the carotid atherosclerotic plaque as observed with 3.0 Tesla dynamic~     contrast-enhanced MRI and histology. Moreover, the investigators aim to investigate the~     correlation between the volume of the LRNC as determined by dual-energy CT and histology.~      Secondly, the investigators will investigate the correlation between the volume of the LRNC,~     the fibrous cap status and the volume of the calcifications determined by MRI versus~     histology, the correlation between number of microembolisms and fibrous cap status and the~     correlation between the deformation pattern seen with ultrasound and the volume of the LRNC.~      The imaging parameters showing good correlation with plaque vulnerability characteristics can~     be used for further analysis in assessing the vulnerable plaque~   ",C0079595,C0024485;C0041618;C0679006;C3203359;C2948600;C2948600;C0040395;C0723338;C0700185;C0019080;C2936350,0,0,-1,3,1.5,0.002246181,0.00060811,0,0,0.006926175

NCT01072032,Cortical and Biomechanical Dynamics of Ankle Robotics Training in Stroke,"Reduced mobility is often a long-term problem facing those who have chronic leg weakness      resulting from stroke. Recent innovations in stroke therapy have applied motor learning      principles to improve motor skills through regular practice of activities using the weaker      limb. Because the ankle provides critical torques for normal walking and mobility function,      impairments at the affected ankle pose a major limitation to achieving optimal mobility      recovery. To address this we have developed a novel ankle robot (Anklebot) to enhance      physical therapy for improving walking and mobility after stroke. This computer controlled      device provides assistance when users cannot complete a movement, but will not assist if the      user is active.      Motor learning requires active involvement in task-related practice to mediate brain      plasticity. While voluntary movement is important to remodel motor control circuits, the      brain mechanisms of reward and motivation also can play an important role. Core brain      networks involved in reward and motivation increase a person's involvement with their      surroundings, to focus attention and to prompt one to approach reward and avoid punishment.      This increased involvement and the elevated emotions associated with it have been shown to      enhance performance, memory and learning.      The purpose of this study is to investigate responses of brain and motor behavior of stroke      patients who use the Anklebot during a 3-week / 3-session/week motor learning based training.      These responses are compared to a 3-week delayed entry period in which the participants will      perform an at-home walking program of equal time. After the 3-week delayed entry walking      program, subjects are divided into low and high reward-feedback groups. The low      reward-feedback group receives the Anklebot training with only immediate feedback on target      successes, without cumulative scores and with minimal social interaction with the      researchers.

NCT01706146,Rhythm Evaluation for AntiCoagulaTion With COntinuous Monitoring,"~     Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained abnormal rhythm of the heart, affects~     an estimated 2.5 to 5 million individuals in the US, and can lead to stroke, heart failure,~     and premature death. For those with AF and other stroke risk factors, chronic anticoagulation~     is recommended to prevent intracardiac thrombus formation and stroke even if the AF is~     infrequent or short-lived. This standard of care is based partly on our inability to rapidly~     recognize and respond to AF recurrences which can often be brief and asymptomatic, but~     exposes the patient to the risk of anticoagulant-induced hemorrhage even during prolonged~     periods of sinus rhythm where the risk of stroke is presumably low.~      Recent advances in device technology and drug therapy, however, have the potential to change~     the way the investigators manage AF. The use of a small leadless subcutaneous implantable~     cardiac monitor with remote data transmission capabilities (Reveal XT, Medtronic Inc.)~     provides the ability to remotely and continuously evaluate a patient for AF recurrences, even~     episodes that are brief and asymptomatic. In addition, release of unique oral thrombin~     inhibitor approved for use in non-valvular AF(Dabigatran [Pradaxa], Rivaroxaban [Xarelto])~     allows for rapid onset anticoagulation within minutes to hours of a single oral dose.~     Together, these advances allow for continuous AF monitoring with targeted anticoagulation~     only around the time of an AF episode, thereby reducing the risk of drug-induced hemorrhage~     while still protecting against stroke.~      The aim of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of intermittent anticoagulation with~     a rapid-onset oral thrombin inhibitor guided by a continuous AF-sensing implantable cardiac~     monitor (Reveal XT) with remote data transmission capabilities.~   ",C0220825;C0871269,C0004238;C0035648;C0232201;C0013216;C1739768;C0019080;C0205161;C0087086;C0040018;C0871269;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0018787;C0018787;C2948600;C0179608;C0003280;C0034897;C0034897;C0019080;C0040018;C0723338;C2348066;C0588436;C2732140;C1330542,16,413,-1,13,13,0.000506773,0.001679466,0,0,0.007598357

SUMMARY:      The best treatment for prevention of another stroke or TIA in patients with narrowing of one      of the arteries in the brain is uncertain. A common treatment is the use of anti-clotting      medications to prevent blood clots from forming in the narrowed vessel. There are a variety      of medicines used for this purpose. These medications are usually taken for the rest of a      patient's life.      However, a treatment that has been used successfully together with anti-clotting medications      in patients with narrowing of the blood vessels of the heart is now being studied in the      blood vessels of the brain. This treatment is called stenting.      Recent research has also indicated a benefit in prevention of recurring stroke by Intensive      Medical Therapy, which is defined as treating risk factors for stroke like high blood      pressure, elevated LDL (low density lipids - the ""bad"" form of cholesterol) and diabetes. The      purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of either Intensive Medical      Therapy PLUS Stenting or Intensive Medical Therapy ONLY in preventing stroke, heart attacks      or death.
