NCT00938977,The Obesity-hypoventilation Syndrome Study of Clinical Characteristics and Predictive Factors of Response to Treatment,"Main objective:      To describe clinical and functional characteristics of the obese hypoventilating patient; to      study the relation between the obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and the obstructive      sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). In the second stage of the study, to assess patient      response to non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) and continuous positive airway pressure      (CPAP), and to identify predictors of unfavourable response to treatment.      Methodology:        -  Patients: Patients with obesity degree I-III, with pCO2 awake and at rest > 45 mmHg,           with no underlying pulmonary or neuromuscular lung disease; two control groups, one of           non-hypoventilating obese patients and the other of obese patients with OSAHS, will also           be studied over the same period.        -  Design: Prospective observational study. In the first stage anthropometric, clinical,           functional and metabolic data will be recorded for the obese hypoventilating patients           and the two control groups (obese patients without respiratory pathology, and obese           patients with OSAHS).      In the second stage patients with OHS will be divided into two subgroups: group 1: patients      with polysomnography (PSG) suggestive of hypoventilation, in whom NIV treatment will be      initiated; group 2: patients with PSG suggestive of OSAHS (apnea-hypopnea index >15), who      will be administered CPAP. Patients will be examined one month and three months after the      start of treatment. The same measurements will be carried out as at the beginning of the      study, with the exception of the polysomnographic study. Nonetheless, pulse oximetry and      arterial gases will be performed on waking.      Expected Results:      Patients with OHS may be characterized and differentiated from obese patients without      associated respiratory pathology on the basis of clinical, functional and metabolic data.      There is a group of patients with association between OSAHS and OHS that do not respond to      treatment with CPAP, and this unfavorable response can be predicted in advance.",C3203358;C0087111;C0039082;C3272565;C1704632;C0028754;C0947630,C0199451;C0745186;C0199470;C0521982;C0162701;C3203358;C0034108;C0441767;C0024115;C0441767;C0037315;C0004083;C0018017;C0024109;C0677042;C0087111;C0087111;C0677042;C0087111;C0235546;C0039082;C1704632;C0235546;C0332128;C1517001;C1704632;C0028754;C0028754;C0441861;C0699809;C0542560;C1552839;C0025344;C1552839;C0442696;C0028754;C0947630;C0947630;C0234422;C0028754;C0028754;C0947630;C1300072;C0028754;C0028754;C0028754;C0003578;C0918012;C1561542;C1552850;C0947630;C0947630;C0028754;C3245479;C3245479;C0042497;C0042497;C0182339;C1561593;C1964257;C0233492;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0969625;C2825142;C4067746;C0562230;C1254545;C0022396;C0031843;C0031843;C2707259;C2707259;C3858576;C1561542;C1552839;C1328018;C1552839;C3203358;C3203358;C3203358;C3272565;C1334278;C3272565;C0182913;C0003842;C3272565,0,0,0,5,5.0,0.018303276,0.014696754,0,1,0.04461659663865546

NCT00408850,Effects of Pioglitazone Treatment on Sympathetic Nervous System Function in Metabolic Syndrome Obesity,"An abdominal distribution of fat is associated with the greatest heart disease risk, because      commonly, several risk factors of metabolic origin cluster in these individuals. When this      occurs the condition is called the 'metabolic syndrome'.      Increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system resulting in enhanced release of the      stress hormone 'noradrenaline', may be one mechanism by which adverse cardiovascular and      metabolic sequela of the metabolic syndrome might be mediated. Impaired insulin action may be      one factor contributing to increased noradrenaline release.      The aim of this Study is to determine whether treatment with a drug called pioglitazone which      is known to improve insulin action, results in reduced sympathetic nervous system activity      and stress hormone release when compared to treatment with a dummy drug (placebo).",C0524620;C0071097;C0087111;C1705273;C0027769;C0028754,C1113667;C0524620;C0524620;C3887460;C0028351;C0028351;C0035648;C0071097;C0000726;C0012634;C0087111;C0087111;C0027769;C0680255;C0543419;C0021641;C0680255;C0021641;C0027769;C0680255;C0032042;C1550512;C0038435;C0038435;C0947630;C0013227;C0013227;C0015677;C0474395;C0184511;C1378698;C2707259;C2707259;C0127400;C4049938;C0151576;C4082977,0,0,0,11,2.75,0.015956337,0.019575728,0,0,0.040941635394035156

NCT01116856,Nutrition and Physical Activity for Obesity,"~     At the present time, scientific consensus exists on obesity multifactorial etiopatogenia. As~     well, professionals and researchers agree that the treatment must approach several scopes,~     such as dietetic, physical activity, pharmacologic and surgical. These two last ones should~     not be the first election and must be reserved for those cases of morbid obesities or in case~     the previous ones have failed. The combination of diet and exercise is still not sufficiently~     studied, in special, the addition of strength training, as we propose in this project, for~     which established intervention protocols do not exist, and that could suppose an additional~     benefit in the reduction of risk factors.~      Therefore, the objectives that we aim in this project are enumerated below:~        -  To discover which are the most effective training protocols and to determine what type~          of exercise combined with nutrition is more appropriate for obesity intervention~          programs.~        -  To establish the relationship between markers related with cardiovascular risk~          (adopokines and lipid profile) and the different intervention protocols proposed.~        -  To describe the influence of nine genetic polymorphisms (selected by their relationship~          with the energy expense and the physical yield) on the effect of different training~          protocols.~        -  To determine how important is body composition (fat mass and muscle mass mainly) in~          total daily energy expenditure.~        -  To establish rules of nutritional and exercise intervention that can be applied in~          public and private training centers. If the proposed objectives are fulfilled, this~          would contribute to an improvement in patients health in long term, along with an~          enormous saving in public health. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to propose~          new lines of intervention in overweight and obese adults that, until now, little have~          been investigated. This way, resistance training is proposed in combination with~          cardiovascular training and endocrinologic treatment. It fits to emphasize that, as far~          as we know, it is the first project of these characteristics, that puts in touch the~          public and private sector (hospitals, universities and fitness area), to establish~          standardized relations protocols to allow a close pursuit of obese patients.~   ",C0028754;C4255207;C0162429,C0872279;C3887460;C3887460;C0486616;C0497406;C0150312;C0028754;C0028754;C3810854;C2948600;C0035648;C1553687;C4255207;C1550543;C0376495;C0162429;C0376495,0,0,1,27,3.375,0.012533958999999999,0.01297313,0,5,0.03733316321829304

NCT03491930,Weight Loss Using a Feedback Device in Obese People With the Metabolic Syndrome,"~     The purpose of this study is to determine if a weight loss app (VA MOVE!® Coach App) along~     with regularly scheduled telephone counseling, will motivate obese people with metabolic~     syndrome to lose weight and improve the symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, compared to usual~     weight loss approaches. This study will randomly assign participants to one of two groups,~     interventional or control. The interventional group will use the app with phone coaching and~     standard of care for weight loss. The control group will receive standard weight loss care~     without the app and phone coaching. Weight loss motivation to adopt life-style changes to~     maintain weight loss and quality of life between the two groups will be compared. The~     metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of disorders including high blood pressure,~     pre-diabetes, the tendency to carry body weight around the waist, and increased fat in the~     blood. When these problems happen together, there is an increased risk for heart attack,~     stroke, diabetes and certain cancers.~      Although the metabolic syndrome is a serious condition, it can be treated with diet, weight~     loss and increased activity. It can even be reversed using these lifestyle changes. Due to~     poor success with routine short-term weight loss treatment (group and one-on-one counseling),~     it is time to address the problem by a different method. Studies have shown feedback devices~     and weight loss apps have been successful in weight loss and weight maintenance. They are~     economical (many apps are free), and convenient to use, without attendance at group sessions.~     Since weight loss is the corner stone for improvement in the symptoms of the MetS, this study~     will offer a unique approach to support individuals who are committed to losing weight and~     adopting a healthier lifestyle.~      Numerous studies demonstrated that feedback via text messaging, and interaction through~     social networking support groups, in addition to iPhone apps, are all more effective in~     weight loss measures than group sessions at a hospital site. (Duncan et al., 2011; Greene,~     Sacks, Piniewski, Kil, & Hahn, 2012; Shaw et al., 2013; Spring et al., 2013). The benefit of~     these various methods is that they appear to accelerate weight loss and prevent weight~     re-gain if employed long-term. With technology changing daily, these approaches must be~     considered an essential adjunct to, or replacement for, traditional group counselling~     sessions.~   ",C0039082,C0010210;C0039082;C1457887;C0039082;C0039082;C0011847;C0011847;C0039082;C1457887;C0557351;C1442065;C0033213;C0025663;C0038454;C0005767;C0005767;C0018787;C1527021;C0033213;C0544691;C0184511;C0025663;C0237547;C0010210;C0376495;C4084774,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0046713779999999995,0.011267548999999998,0,4,0.03668230376949036

NCT02169778,Effect of Intermittent Versus Continuous Energy Restriction on Compensatory Mechanisms Activated During Weight Reduction,"~     Obesity has become a global epidemic with huge public health implications. Although clinical~     significant weight loss can be achieved by a combination of diet and behavioral modification,~     strong metabolic adaptations, with increased appetite and suppressed energy expenditure, are~     activated, which compromise weight loss maintenance and increase the risk of relapse. The aim~     of this project is to compare the effects of intermittent versus continuous energy~     restriction on the compensatory responses previously described using two low calory diets,~     with a similar macronutrient distribution. More specifically, this study will analyze, in the~     short-term, if an intermittent energy restricted diet is associated with less appetite and~     low reduction in energy expenditure when compared with a continuous energy restricted diet.~     This project can bring large practical benefits concerning the design of weight loss programs~     to minimize weight relapse.~   ",0,C0014499;C0028754;C0035020;C3840684;C0242970;C1553687;C2728259;C0035020;C0185026,0,0,-1,8,8.0,0.001626016,0.011505797,0,0,0.03504864311315924

NCT02048215,Effect on Energy Metabolism at Cellular Level of Diet Plus Treatment With Ephedrine and Caffeine in Obesity,"Brief Summary This trial was part of a sub-project targeted to diet, thermogenesis and      obesity of a larger multicentre study named ""Interaction between nutritional,      social-behavioral and metabolic factors for prevention of cardiovascular disease: development      of nutritional strategies on general population"".      Ephedrine and caffeine (EC) combination has been widely used in human obesity treatment. It      is known that this drug increases the metabolic rate in both animals and humans. Ephedrine is      an agonist of both a and ß-adrenoceptors; moreover, it induces norepinephrine release from      sympathetic neurons. Caffeine increases both norepinephrine and dopamine release and      stimulates the neuronal activity in several brain regions. We hypothesize that EC treatment      might exert a specific effect on lipolysis and thermogenesis by stimulation of beta-3      adrenoreceptors on adipose tissue and by stimulating uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation,      i.e. energy being dissipated as heat rather than being converted to adenosine triphosphate      (ATP)      Our study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week trial to investigate the effect of      hypocaloric diet alone or coupled to EC treatment of morbidly obese women on thermogenesis,      expression of UCP 3 (in muscle tissue) and of beta-3 adrenoreceptors (in adipose tissue).      Subjects are randomly assigned to EC (200/20 mg) or to placebo administered three times a day      orally together with a energy-deficit diet (70% of resting energy expenditure), starting one      month before undergoing bariatric surgery. Primary study endpoints are weight change analysed      by intention to treat, changes in resting energy expenditure, UCP3 (long and short isoform),      messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels in rectus abdominis and immunostaining for beta-3      adrenoreceptors in subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue. Also plasma epinephrine,      norepinephrine, triglycerides, free fatty acids, glycerol, TSH, free thyroxine (fT4), free      triiodothyronine (fT3) fasting glucose, insulin and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)      index, are measured at baseline and at the end of treatments.",C0014272;C0087111;C0014479;C0178539;C0006644;C0028754;C2946261;C0012159,C0007222;C0001480;C0014272;C0014272;C1456587;C0206066;C0041014;C0870882;C0028351;C0028351;C0028351;C0018841;C1273723;C0018841;C0018841;C0005911;C0243107;C1292856;C0014563;C0199176;C0679199;C0185117;C0031809;C0087111;C0014479;C0087111;C0014479;C0087111;C0023796;C0087111;C0162425;C0169911;C0040165;C0006644;C0006644;C0013030;C1552740;C1552601;C0017861;C1706244;C0028754;C0028754;C3540698;C2987634;C0680255;C0680255;C0032042;C0032042;C0028977;C0015663;C0017725;C0021641;C1518681;C0424589;C1518681;C0424589;C0032105;C0947630;C0027365;C0015264;C0947630;C0456909;C0439044;C0028754;C1561542;C0947630;C3161035;C0918012;C1273517;C0013227;C0175306;C1561538;C3539181;C0202236;C2707262;C2707262;C2986890;C2911690;C2246906;C2707259;C0018792;C0018792;C1553886;C4049938;C0728774,0,0,1,4,4.0,0.015754585,0.018741941,0,0,0.0342173215158071

NCT00118963,Effect of Repaglinide Versus Metformin Treatment in Non-Obese Patients With Type-2-Diabetes,"Aim:      The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) showed a reduction in cardiovascular      events in obese patients with type-2-diabetes treated with metformin compared with other      hypoglycaemic treatments with no difference in glycemic control between treatments. Non-obese      patients with type-2-diabetes are usually treated with insulin-secretagogues or insulin when      diet fails. Since non-obese patients with type-2-diabetes also carry a high risk of      cardiovascular events, the use of metformin for this sub-group of patients might be more      beneficial. Moreover, when insulin-treatment is initiated ongoing oral hypoglycaemic agents      (OHA) are often continued, but in non-obese patients with type-2 diabetes little evidence      exist for choosing the optimal class of OHA to be combined with insulin. The aim of the      project is therefore to investigate the effect of metformin vs. an insulin-secretagogue      (repaglinide) in combination with insulin on glycemic control and non-glycemic cardiovascular      risk-factors in non-obese patients with type-2-diabetes, uncontrolled on diet alone.      Methodology:      Single-center, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel study involving 100 non-obese      (BMI 27 kg/m2 or lower) patients with type-2-diabetes investigating the effect of treatment      with metformin vs. repaglinide each in combination with biphasic insulin (Insulin-aspart      30/70, BIAsp30) for a period of 12 months.",C0246689;C0025598;C0087111;C0028754;C1550655,C1320716;C3887460;C3887460;C0020616;C0020616;C0246689;C0246689;C0087111;C0087111;C4551656;C0025598;C0332167;C0025598;C0087111;C0025598;C0087111;C0025598;C0011847;C0011849;C0021641;C0021641;C0021641;C0021641;C0021641;C0021641;C0021641;C0021641;C2003521;C1518681;C1549113;C1518681;C0025344;C0947630;C0028754;C0028754;C0028754;C0699809;C0028754;C0456387;C0028754;C0439044;C0456909;C0947630;C0028754;C2948600;C3539181;C3539181;C4699604;C4704833;C4704833;C0969625;C0085632;C1552839;C4554418;C0332155;C0332155;C1444662,0,0,0,13,13.0,0.016768356,0.017080447,0,0,0.03028083028083028
NCT01138423,Treatment of Adiposity Related hypErTension (TARGET),"High blood pressure (hypertension) is an important cause of myocardial infarction and stroke.      High blood pressure often occurs in people who are overweight. These people frequently also      have abnormal fat and sugar metabolism. The combination of these problems is called the      'metabolic syndrome'.      People with hypertension and obesity currently receive the same drug therapy as people with      hypertension, but without obesity. Different classes of drugs are thought to be equally      effective in lowering blood pressure.      Next to lowering blood pressure, hypertension treatment can have additional effects, like      changes in blood vessel function (the ability to dilate and constrict) or changes is the      metabolism of sugar and fat. Particularly in patients with the metabolic syndrome, these      additional effects are thought to be of great importance, because they can influence the risk      for cardiovascular diseases.      The blood pressure lowering mechanism differs between classes of blood pressure lowering      medication. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of three types of blood      pressure lowering medication belonging to different classes. The main outcomes of interest      will be blood vessel function (the ability to dilate and constrict) and blood pressure.

NCT00886626,GLP-1 Therapy for Weight Loss and Improved Glucose Tolerance in Obese Children,"The prevalence of severely obese children is on the rise. Behavioral therapies for weight      loss are successful in some, but others need more aggressive approaches such as drug therapy.      In addition, up to 25% of severely obese children have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT),      which places them at significantly elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and      cardiovascular disease. Although various drug therapies for weight loss and IGT have been      explored in adults, few have been evaluated in children.      Recently, a new drug class has emerged that targets deficiencies of GLP-1. One of the main      glycemic mechanisms of action of the GLP-1 agonists such as exenatide is to enhance glucose      disposal in the postprandial setting and improve glucose tolerance. In addition, exenatide      can induce weight loss by decreasing appetite and slowing gastric motility.",C1262477;C0013220;C0184511;C0087111;C0017725;C0028754,C0271650;C0011860;C0007222;C0178665;C0013216;C0013216;C1262477;C1262477;C2986890;C0442797;C0087111;C0167117;C0167117;C0205082;C0205082;C0243192;C0003618;C0678835;C3540008;C0017725;C0542559;C0038351;C1305866;C3539125;C0028754;C0028754;C0456387;C0013227;C1578513;C0184511;C1547300;C0031327;C0220825;C0856882;C0180799;C0162538,8,66,0,22,22.0,0.016056766,0.01574431,0,3,0.03828877005347594
NCT01237197,Exenatide in Extreme Pediatric Obesity,"~     Extreme pediatric obesity, the fastest growing category of obesity in youth, is associated~     with high risk for developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM).~     Obesity tracks strongly into adulthood and interventions early in life may reduce risk for~     developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Few drug therapies for weight loss~     have been evaluated in adolescents. Since exenatide is associated with weight loss and~     improves risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in adults, it may be~     useful in extremely obese youth. Our primary objective in this study is to generate~     preliminary data on the ability of exenatide to reduce body mass index (BMI) and improve risk~     factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in 26 extremely obese adolescents (age~     12-19 years) in a three-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot clinical~     trial.
