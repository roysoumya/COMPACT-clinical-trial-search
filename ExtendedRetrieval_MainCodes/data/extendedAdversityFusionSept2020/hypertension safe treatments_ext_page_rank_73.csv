NCT00125918,PHIRST-1: Tadalafil in the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of tadalafil for the      treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.,C0020538;C1176316;C0087111;C2707265;C0003842,C0020538;C4553491;C1176316;C0087111;C0024109;C0947630;C0220825,0,0,1,164,164,0.016267215,0.019006154,0,1,0.044387537
NCT01643434,Resistant Hypertension Optimal Treatment,"Resistant hypertension (ReHy) is an emerging clinical and public health problem which tends      to increase because populations are living longer and there is a growing global epidemic of      obesity, diabetes and sleep apnea. It is also tempting to speculate that the excessive      dietary salt ingestion reported in many countries can contribute substantially to the risk of      ReHy development. ReHy is defined as persistent high blood pressure (above the target goal)      in spite of the use of at least 3 antihypertensive agents of different classes, one of them      must being diuretics.      Data regarding the exact prevalence of ReHy are very limited. In addition, little data is      available about 3-drug combinations but a simplified treatment algorithm has demonstrated      that a combination of a diuretic plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or      an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) plus diuretic, adding a calcium channel blocker when      necessary, controlled 64% of hypertensive patients and, in addition, was even more efficient      than the current guideline-based management. By contrast, the fourth drug to be added-on the      triple regimen is still controversial and guided by empirical choices or personal      preferences. Recent studies suggest the emerging role of spironolactone as the ""first-line""      fourth drug for treating resistant hypertension. Conversely, because of the      pathophysiological rationale, others have proposed the use of ?-blockers or even centrally      acting agents for managing the sympathetic hyperactivity. The present concerns about the      limited blood pressure reducing effect of ?-blockers, especially in elderly people, the      potent effect of centrally acting agents and our personal experience are pointing to      clonidine as the fourth drug to be added-on to a multidrug combination for reaching optimal      blood pressure in patients with ReHy. Nevertheless, no studies have been performed comparing,      head-to-head, which one is the best fourth drug (spironolactone or clonidine) to be added-on      to a common used multidrug combination in order to treat this condition.      Therefore, the principal objectives of the ReHOT Trial are to assess prospectively: (1) the      prevalence of ReHy in a cohort of outpatients with stage II hypertension; (2) the effect of      spironolactone on blood pressure, in comparison to clonidine, when added to a multidrug      combination consisting of chlorthalidone plus ACEi (or ARB) plus amlodipine, all of 3      up-titrated to the highest dose; (3) the role of measuring sympathetic nervous system      activity and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity on predicting the response of blood      pressure to spironolactone and clonidine.",C0020538;C1514892;C0087111,C0003364;C0006684;C0020538;C0014432;C0037982;C0005823;C0005823;C0037982;C0037982;C0005823;C0008294;C0037982;C0699943;C0424295;C0020538;C3539181;C0857121;C0020538;C0020538;C0037315;C0243107;C0003018;C0003018;C0003018;C0002006;C0376636;C0237607;C0018017;C0051696;C1514892;C0012798;C0087111;C0002045;C0282423;C0009014;C0009014;C0012634;C0009014;C0009014;C0011849;C0700287;C0012798;C0012798;C1704632;C0460139;C0033213;C0028754;C0456387;C0040808;C0947630;C0150312;C0947630;C0027769;C3539125;C1518681;C1518681;C3245511;C1518681;C1300072;C0005767;C0037494;C0018017;C3245479;C0013227;C1704326;C0013227;C0013227;C0018670;C0018670;C0013227;C1273517;C1704326;C3539181;C3539181;C3539181;C3539181;C3845947;C4684637;C0776963;C1979715;C1514811;C2911690;C3653883;C1514892;C0449900;C0776963;C0776963;C0776963;C1522411;C0776963;C4697740;C0037816;C1707944;C3272565;C1707944;C1548344;C0201956;C4049938;C4049938;C3834249;C0277785;C0546816,0,0,1,7,3.5,0.019494719,0.020308932,0,0,0.041278367

NCT02272283,Optical Coherence Tomography Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Stent Implantation,"~     Coronary artery disease is one of the most prevalent diseases in the western countries.~      A waxy substance called plaque can build up inside the coronary arteries. Over time, plaque~     can harden or rupture, and cause narrowing (stenosis) of the arteries and reduce the flow of~     oxygen-rich blood to the heart.~      The standard treatment of symptomatic coronary stenosis is percutaneous coronary intervention~     (PCI) with balloon dilation followed by stent implantation.~      A stent is a small metallic grid that stabilizes the coronary vessel wall after the balloon~     dilation.~      Currently, drug-eluting stents (DES) are the most widely used stent types. DESs consist of a~     metallic backbone and an antiprolifetive drug-coating bound by a polymer (glue). These~     devices have reduced the incidence of excessive formation of new tissue (in-stent restenosis)~     dramatically in comparison with previously used bare-metal stents.~      However, there are safety concerns with DES, since later thrombotic events have been~     reported.~      On one hand excessive tissue formation inside the stent can cause in-stent restenosis, and on~     the other hand insufficient coverage of the stent can cause persistently exposed metalllic~     material that can induce platelet aggregation and thrombus-formation.~      The etiology to stent thrombosis is multifactorial. Possible predisposing factors are, among~     others: 1) hypersensitivity towards the polymer-coating, which may induce delayed healing~     inside and around the stent, and 2) insufficient contact between the stent and the underlying~     coronary vessel wall (incomplete stent apposition), which may cause flow-disturbance and~     delayed healing.~      Delayed healing causes persistently exposed metallic material that can induce platelet~     aggregation and thrombus-formation.~      The Nobori stent is a new-generation DES, coated with a thin layer of drug and a~     bioabsorbable polymer. The drug is localized on the outer side of the stent, and decreases~     the release of drug to the blood circulation. The bioabsorbable polymer is degraded after 6-9~     months after implantation, and decreases the risk of hypersensitivity-reactions in the vessel~     wall.~      The improved pharmacokinetic profile of the stent is thought to improve the healing pattern.~      At routine coronary angiography, a small plastic tube is inserted in the femoral artery under~     local anesthesia. Thin, flexible catheters are then advanced through the artery system~     (femoral artery and aorta) to the coronary arteries. Contrast is injected in to the blood~     stream by the catheters, and the arteries are depicted by a special X-ray technique during~     dye-release. By angiography, the outer sides of the coronary arteries are visualized, and~     balloon dilations and stent implantations are guided by this standard technique.~      Newer studies have documented that stent placement and expansion is superiorly visualized if~     supplementary intravascular imaging is performed during stent implantation.~      Small imaging catheters are wired through the vessel after stent implantation, and film the~     stent retrogradely through the vessel.~      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) visualizes the complete vessel wall by use of sound waves,~     and stent expansion is evaluated in detail.~      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a newer light-based, high-resolution technology. The~     technique can depict every thread (strut) from the stent, enabling visualization of both~     contact between struts and underlying vessel wall immediately after the procedure, and strut~     coverage at follow-up.~      The purpose of this study is to determine whether OCT-guided PCI can improve healing and~     coverage of the stent in comparison with routine angiographic guidance alone in patients~     indicating PCI due to myocardial infarction.~      If OCT-guidance improves coverage of the stent, this might lower the later thrombotic risk.~      Patients hospitalized due to myocardial infarction are randomized either to OCT-guided or~     angio-guided stent implantation in the present study. In both groups the Nobori stent is~     implanted according to standard techniques. In the angio-guided group, implantations are~     guided by angiography alone. OCT- and IVUS analysis are performed after an angiographic~     optimal result for documentary reasons. The operator is blinded towards the image findings,~     and analysis is performed offline later.~      In the OCT-guided group, both OCT and IVUS analysis is interpreted immediately after the~     acquisition. If stent apposition and/or expansion is deemed suboptimal, additional balloon~     dilation and/or stenting is performed. In case of OCT-driven stent optimization, a~     documentary OCT and IVUS is performed to document the final result.~      Patients are readmitted 6 months later for a control angiogram inclusive OCT to assess stent~     coverage.~      Furthermore, patients are readmitted 12 months after the index procedure for a control~     angiogram including OCT and IVUS to assess dynamic vessel wall responses.~   ",C1532338;C0040395,C1456025;C1956346;C0027051;C0085532;C0002921;C0040053;C1301725;C0040395;C0002978;C0002978;C0003842;C1261287;C0003842;C1261287;C0087086;C0332149;C0087086;C0184511;C0003842;C0003842;C0003842;C1171285;C2348535;C3203359;C0150312;C0030054;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0148346;C0005767;C0005767;C0003483;C1704922;C0918012;C0018563;C0018563;C1532338;C0027051;C0004704;C1301746;C0012634;C0184511;C0184511;C0004704;C0148346;C0577620;C0577620;C1522577;C1261287;C0005767;C1449882;C1449882;C2947996;C2947996;C2947996;C2947996;C2947996;C0184511;C1630418;C0376495;C0012725,0,0,0,4,4,0.014409222,0.00985268,0,1,0.038332639

Even so, a significant proportion of patients will~     develop resistant hypertension. In recent years, renal denervation has been argued as an~     effective means to address blood pressure problem in several non-Chinese clinical trials.

NCT01761916,Clonidine Versus Captopril for Treatment of Postpartum Very High Blood Pressure,"The postpartum period represents a stage of the pregnancy-puerperal still rarely addressed      scientifically. There are no reports in the literature and concrete enough to elucidate      important issues, especially in the field of hypertension and pregnancy.      Searches based on current evidence concentrate their focus on the diagnosis of hypertensive      disorders and treatment of these diseases maternofetais repercussions. However, the prognosis      in the short and long term, as the BP outcome in mothers with severe preeclampsia, the most      effective treatment for the control of hypertensive crisis and metabolic and cardiovascular      events after two years of termination of pregnancy require further clarification.      The main idea for developing this research came from the clinical experience with the use of      captopril in Obstetric ICU IMIP. This drug has long been used in postpartum women with severe      preeclampsia or chronic hypertension exacerbated by pregnancy for control of hypertensive      crisis and keeping pressure levels. Following the technical standards of the institution and      during his administration, there were reports of side effects such as dry cough and nausea,      beyond the threshold dose of 150mg daily captopril was easily achieved hindering control the      use of hypotensive.      Alternative therapy, clonidine began to be used in mothers with some restriction on the use      of ACE inhibitors and its hypotensive effect for peak pressure was satisfactory. What is not      known yet is how long clonidine reduces high blood pressure and how long to leave stabilized      compared to the use of captopril.      There are no reports in the literature databases, no randomized clinical trials that prove      the effectiveness of clonidine for the treatment of hypotensive pressure peaks in this      particular group of patients, even in comparison with other classes of antihypertensive      drugs, especially captopril, to this purpose.

REACH will      also evaluate improvement in lifestyle behaviors that include diet, exercise, smoking, and      adherence to prescribed medications. Finally, we will quantify the amount of e-counseling      support that is required during REACH to evoke a significant reduction in blood pressure. It      is hypothesized that e-Counseling (vs. Control) will significantly improve blood pressure and      lifestyle behaviours at the 12-month assessment.
