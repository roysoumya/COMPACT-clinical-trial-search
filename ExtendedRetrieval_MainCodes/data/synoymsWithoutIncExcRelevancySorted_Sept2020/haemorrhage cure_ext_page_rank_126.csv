NCT02202967,Misoprostol for Small Bowel Ulcers and Obscure Bleeding Due to Aspirin or Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs,"Anti-inflammatory tablets (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) continue to be used      commonly worldwide to relieve pain caused by arthritis. Likewise, aspirin is used by many      patients in order to prevent blood clots. Despite their desired benefits, these medicines can      cause internal bleeding from the digestive system. The source of this bleeding can be obvious      (overt), or obscure and thought to come from the small intestine. Obscure bleeding can show      as anemia due to lack of iron in the blood. Small intestine ulcers are now easily diagnosed      using an endoscope the size of a big pill (video capsule endoscopy). Small bowel ulcers are      not related to stomach acid and therefore do not heal using remedies usually taken to stop      acid formation. A different drug, misoprostol, consists of a chemical (prostaglandin) that is      usually lacking in patients using aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs. Misoprostol is licenced      to heal stomach and duodenal ulcers in patients using these drugs. Our hypothesis is that      misoprostol might be effective in healing small bowel ulcers as suggested by pilot studies;      however, such works only included small numbers of patients, did not include control groups      and both patients and investigators knew the nature of the tablets used. To test this      hypothesis, we propose to compare misoprostol to a dummy tablet. The numbers of subjects to      be studied have been calculated using established statistical methods",C0003209;C0085174;C0021852;C0019080;C0004057;C0041582;C0013227,C0003212;C0003209;C0151971;C0021852;C0013295;C0033554;C0722425;C0302148;C0021852;C0085174;C0085174;C0085174;C0021852;C0085174;C0003864;C0011900;C0014243;C0014245;C0019080;C0019080;C0019080;C0004057;C0038351;C0004057;C0038351;C0043240;C0947630;C0025663;C0449416;C0002871;C0332219;C0041582;C0041582;C1552839;C0005767;C0013227;C0013227;C1273517;C1273517;C0302583;C0043240;C0013227;C0043240;C1273517;C0392366;C0003209;C0871633;C0233492;C1561528;C0013227;C0012238;C3244072;C1706074;C1522411;C1441792;C3272558,0,0,0,0,0,0.00819864,0.009841285,0,2
NCT02241044,Argon Plasma Coagulation for Bleeding Peptic Ulcers,"Background:      A second endoscopic method added to injection therapy is recommended for high-risk bleeding      peptic ulcers. Many endoscopic devices have been proved as useful hemostatic instruments,      whereas the hemostatic efficacy of argon plasma coagulation (APC) has not been widely      investigated.      Aim:      This study was designed to know whether additional APC treatment could influence the      hemostatic efficacy after endoscopic injection therapy in treating high-risk bleeding ulcers.      Methods:      From October 2010 to January 2012, eligible patients who had high-risk bleeding ulcers were      admitted to our hospital. They prospectively randomly underwent either APC therapy plus      distilled water injection or distilled water injection alone. Pantoprazole infusion was      conducted during the fasting period after endoscopy and orally for 8 weeks to encourage ulcer      healing. Episodes of rebleeding were retreated with endoscopic combination therapy. Patients      who did not benefit from retreatment underwent emergency surgery or transarterial      embolization (TAE).",C1879736;C0030920;C0019080,C0009429;C0444472;C0444472;C0333291;C0333291;C0790233;C0790233;C0030920;C0081876;C0013931;C0441509;C0376495;C0019120;C0019120;C0019120;C0087111;C0021485;C0021485;C0014245;C1546399;C0019080;C0184666;C0574032;C0025663;C0087111;C0015663;C0043240;C0543467;C0025663;C0032105;C0025344;C0947630;C0439044;C0041582;C0033036;C2948600;C0033036;C0033036;C4554108;C1550655;C0014245;C0014245;C0014245;C0014245;C0019080;C0776963;C0681290;C0870365,0,0,0,0,0,0.009729494,0.011477596,0,1
NCT03061604,RCT to Determine the Efficacy of Combining Hemospray With Medical Treatment in Acute Variceal Bleeding,"INTRODUCTION Acute variceal bleeding (AVB) is a severe complication of portal hypertension in      patients with liver cirrhosis. The primary therapy includes the administration of vasoactive      drugs, antibiotics and endoscopic therapy; preferably esophageal banding ligation (EBL)      and/or cyanoacrylate injection when bleeding occurs from gastric varices.      In this context, the idea is to assess ""Hemospray"" (Cook Medical, Winston-Salem, NC) as an      initial therapy in patients with massive bleeding as a temporary ""bridge"" until definitive      treatment could be instituted.      The data generated from the pilot study performed between Erasme hospital, ULB and TBRI ,      Cairo showed that adding Hemospray as early as possible in the management steps could      increase the bleeding control rate up to 95 % at 24 hours.      OBJECTIVE The primary efficacy objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Hemospray      in combination with standard of care (SOC) medical treatment compared to the efficacy of SOC      in the Control Arm in patient with acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patient.      The primary safety objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of Hemospray when used      in combination with SOC compared to SOC in the Control Arm.      1.1. Secondary:        -  To evaluate the effect of timing of Hemospray treatment on the outcomes of bleeding           patients        -  To evaluate the adverse effects on both therapeutic regimens (SAEs and clinically           significant AEs).",C0087111;C0019080;C0199168;C1547229,C0020541;C0333279;C0149533;C2936643;C0023890;C1708063;C0017145;C0879626;C1533734;C0009566;C0003232;C0376636;C0021485;C3245481;C0087111;C0018017;C0018017;C0087111;C0018017;C0087111;C0019080;C0023690;C0019080;C0332149;C0019080;C0019080;C2945654;C0087111;C0185014;C0542559;C0199168;C0087111;C0205082;C0456378;C1518681;C1547229;C0013227;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C3245479;C1273517;C0446516;C0446516;C3539181;C3539181;C0087111;C0376495;C0776963;C0014245;C0011164;C0027627;C0220825;C0220825;C0220825;C1564718;C1564718,0,0,1,3,3,0.008701599,0.011411071,0,1
NCT01779713,Transcriptomic Signature of Vasospasm Consecutive to Sub-arachnoid Aneurismal Hemorrhage,"Rational: The main danger with intracranial aneurism is its rupture conjugated with      subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) occurrence. SAH is a severe pathology leading not only to      neurological but also extra cerebral disorders. The major cause of morbidity and mortality      when developing a SAH is the secondary development of a delayed cerebral ischemia consecutive      to a prolonged vasospasm of cerebral arteries. The understanding of the pathophysiological      mechanisms of SAH complication, such as vasospasm which is the more frequent, is essential.      Vasospasm is defined as a reversible shrinking of an artery lumen diameter in the      subarachnoid space, beginning generally between 4 and 12 days after the hemorrhage. Such a      vasospasm could have a huge clinical impact leading to delayed neurological ischemic      deficiency in 17 to 40 % of cases. Up to day, mechanisms involved in vasospasm occurrence are      not well described.      Disposing of well-established genetics and transcriptomics databases along with cerebral      ischemia and inflammation is essential to unravel the mechanisms leading to vasospasm      occurrence on SAH patients. It will enable researchers to better comprehend SAH pathology and      elaborate an efficient and individualized therapeutic strategy to SAH acute phase in order to      reduce the risk of vasospasm occurrence.      Aims: 1) Constitute DNA and RNA Biobank via blood proofing oh SAH patients 2) Constitute a      database grouping clinical and biological data 3) Look for genetic and transcriptomic early      markers via genomic approaches 4) Correlate these different markers with vasospasm occurrence      and clinical evolution of the patients      Study: Patients inclusion will be done following their admission (D1) in the "" unité de      réanimation neurochirurgicale"" of Pitié-Salpètrière Hospital. After obtaining of the informed      consent, blood proofing will be realized daily during 12 days: one daily 2.5ml tube for the      transcriptomic study and a single 10ml EDTA tube for genetic analyses. Clinical and      biological follow-up will be performed as usual.      200 patients will be initially included during 2 to 3 years for the transcriptomic study of      which 1/3 will develop vasospastic complication. The transcriptomic study will thus be      performed by comparing patients developing or not developing this complication      Expected Results: Unravel vasospasm early genetic markers.",C0019080;C1519316;C0085616;C0003707,C0038525;C0917798;C0007770;C0600223;C0162340;C0524466;C0009566;C0021368;C0009566;C0009566;C0243107;C0019080;C0677042;C0012634;C0220880;C0027627;C0085616;C0085616;C0085616;C0085616;C0085616;C0242356;C0085616;C0677042;C0085616;C0085616;C0184666;C0085616;C0006104;C0006104;C0022116;C0679199;C0242356;C3272565;C1517001;C3203359;C0205082;C0003842;C0562342;C0087136;C0005767;C0947630;C0005767;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C3245479;C0175730;C0013618;C0175730;C1561538;C0087111;C2948499;C1550655;C2707261;C2707261;C0020621;C4684637;C0005516;C0005516;C2825142;C0376650;C1548762;C1548762;C0679560;C0562357;C0002957;C1101725;C0221874;C1522411;C3272565;C0022116;C3841798;C3272565;C3272565;C2363670;C0277785;C0017313;C0003707;C0151872,0,0,0,0,0,0.007647205,0.010076724,0,1

NCT01123031,Oral vs Intravenous and Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI)for Peptic Ulcer Bleeding (PUB),"A bleeding peptic ulcer remains a serious medical problem with significant morbidity and      mortality. Endoscopic therapy significantly reduces further bleeding, surgery, and mortality      in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers and is now recommended as the first hemostatic      modality for these patients.      In the past few years, adjuvant use of a high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) after      endoscopic therapy has been endorsed in some studies. Laine and Javid et al found that oral      PPI and IV PPI had a similar intragastric pH response in the past two years. Therefore,      whether oral can replace IV in the management of peptic ulcer bleeding is the objective in      this study.      The investigators enrolled 130 patients with active bleeding or nonbleeding visible      vessels(NBVV) in this study. They are randomly assigned as oral lansoprazole or IV nexium      group. All patients receive successful endoscopic therapy with heater probe or hemoclip      placement.      In the lansoprazole group (N=65), 30 mg four times daily is given orally for three days.      Thereafter, the patients receive 30 mg lansoprazole orally daily for two months. In the      nexium group, 160 mg/day continuous infusion is given for three days. Thereafter, the      patients receive 40 mg nexium orally daily for two months.      The primary end point is recurrent bleeding before discharge and within 14 days.

NCT02316990,China Survey of Stress Ulcer Bleeding in Critically Ill Neurosurgical Patients,"Stress ulcers or stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD) is defined as ""acute superficial      inflammation lesions of the gastric mucosa induced when an individual is subject to      abnormally elevated physiologic demands.""[1] Studies have shown that SRMD occurred in      75%-100% ICU patients[1]. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to SRMD is an important complication      in critically ill patients. The frequency of clinically important bleeding ranged from 5.3%      to 33%.[2] The mortality in ICU patients with stress related bleeding approaches 50%, which      is much higher than the patients without bleeding (9%). [3] In 1999, the American Society of      Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) published guidelines on the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis      in medical, surgical, respiratory, and pediatric ICU patients [2]. PPIs and H2RA are widely      used in China current clinical practice for the prevention of stress ulcer bleeding. However,      there is no epidemiology data to show the risk factors for stress ulcer bleeding and the      bleeding rate of Chinese neurosurgical critically ill patients who are usually suffering from      brain trauma, cerebral haemorrhage or brain tumour operation. Information is needed to know      about the characteristics in Chinese critically ill neurosurgical patients.      Objectives of this Non-Interventional Study Primary        1. Primary objective: To estimate the overall incidence of upper gastrointestinal (GI)           bleeding in critically ill neurosurgical patients in China.        2.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of tranexamic acid for decreasing transfusion      requirements and bleeding in this patient population. To evaluate the safety of this      antifibrinolytic agent in the intraoperative and mid-term postoperative period.      METHODS: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with      parallel groups. The main outcome measure is intraoperative and postoperative transfusion      requirements; blood loss and safety will also be evaluated. Previous results in other types      of surgery suggest that tranexamic acid reduces transfusion requirements and blood loss.

NCT01112852,EVL (Endoscopic Variceal Ligation) Plus Vasoconstrictor vs.Ligation Plus PPI( Proton Pump Inhibitor) in the Control of Acute Esophageal Variceal Bleeding,"Previous studies showed that combination of endoscopic therapy with vasoconstrictor is better      than either vasoconstrictor or endoscopic therapy alone in achieving the successful      hemostatsis of acute variceal bleeding. The rationale of using vasoconstrictor is to enhance      the efficacy of hemostasis by endoscopic therapy. Nowadays, endoscopic variceal ligation      (EVL) has replaced endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) as the endoscopic treatment of      choice in the arresting of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage. EVL alone can achieve      hemotasis up to 97% even in cases of active variceal hemorrhage. However, early rebleeding      due to ligation-induced ulcer may be encountered. It appears that prevention of esophageal      ulcers and bleeding by a proton pump inhibitor may be more logical than using a      vasoconstrictor after cessation of bleeding by EVL.",C0358591;C4255305;C0014245;C0023690;C0023690;C0019080;C1547229;C0014867;C1564718,C0358591;C0333106;C0333106;C0042397;C0042397;C0042397;C0042397;C0036435;C0740166;C0199176;C0021485;C0087111;C0019080;C0023690;C0023690;C0019080;C0019080;C0947630;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0041582;C0439044;C0439044;C0041582;C3539181;C1320102;C0180950;C1512346;C0014245;C0014245;C0014245;C0014245;C0014245;C0014245;C0019080,0,0,1,6,6,0.007977621,0.009871416,0,0

However, the optimal interval of EVL remains unclear. Our previous      studies demonstrated that repeating EVL every 3-4 weeks could achieve an appreciable low      incidence of variceal rebleeding and mortality.

NCT01359878,Fibrinogen Concentrate as Initial Treatment for Postpartum Haemorrhage: A Randomised Clinically Controlled Trial,"Severe maternal bleeding is a serious complication of birth and causes 125.000 deaths      worldwide each year. The investigators aim to investigate if early treatment with fibrinogen      concentrate versus saline can reduce the incidence of blood transfusion in women with      postpartum haemorrhage.      A low level of fibrinogen has been associated with increased blood loss and transfusion      requirements in different clinical settings including obstetrical bleeding. Early up-front      treatment with fibrinogen may reduce incidence of transfusion by securing optimal haemostatic      capacity in women with postpartum haemorrhage.      The investigators plan to enrol 245 patients on four hospitals in the Capital Region of      Denmark during a two year period.      As safety measure the investigators plan to use TEG®/Functional Fibrinogen/Rapid-TEG as      haemostatic monitoring of all participants during the trial: Baseline test is taken at      inclusion before administration of fibrinogen concentrate/placebo. Further tests are taken      immediately after intervention, 4 hours and 24 hours after.

NCT01242280,Self-expandable Esophageal Stent Versus Balloon Tamponade in Refractory Esophageal Variceal Bleeding.,"In the last years, important advances have been done in the treatment and prevention of      esophageal variceal bleeding. Experts agree that the combination of pharmacological and      endoscopic therapy should be the first line therapy in the acute bleeding episode; whereas      TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) is considered a rescue therapy.      Nevertheless, some patients would require different therapies to act as a ""bridge"" until      definitive therapy can be instituted. Balloon tamponade (using the Sengstaken tube)      represents, up to now, the most widely used temporary ""bridge"" to TIPS. However, balloon      tamponade is associated with a high incidence of serious adverse events. Recently, the use of      self-expanding metal stents have been introduced in the treatment of acute variceal bleeding      showing a very high hemostatic efficacy with no adverse events. The present study is directed      to compare the efficacy free of adverse events and mortality of self-expanding metal stents      vs balloon tamponade in patients with variceal bleeding refractory to medical and endoscopic      therapy.",C2930473;C0183514;C0019080;C0014867,C0032720;C0333276;C0877248;C0877248;C0877248;C0441290;C0441290;C0199176;C0019120;C0087111;C0087111;C0579016;C3245481;C0579016;C0087111;C0442804;C0579016;C0019080;C0019080;C0019080;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0004704;C0441144;C0150312;C0441144;C0087111;C0456378;C0456378;C0947630;C0175730;C1273517;C1551994;C1551994;C0014867;C3539181;C3245501;C0014245;C0456642;C0014245;C4084912;C4522152,0,0,0,12,12,0.007718673,0.0088729,0,0

NCT03118297,Intervention to End Recurrent Unscheduled Bleeding Trial,"The subdermal etonogestrel (ENG) implant, a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC)      method, is among the most effective forms of reversible contraception and thus, an important      tool in the quest to reduce unintended pregnancy. However, despite overall increases in LARC      use in the United States from 1.5% in 2002 to 7.2% in 2011, and 11.6% most recently in 2015,      implant use continues to make up a small proportion of LARC use. While evidence to explain      this low uptake of implants is lacking, one potential reason is patient and provider concerns      about unpredictable bleeding.      As a result of this, many studies have been performed in attempts to discover therapies for      unscheduled bleeding in progestin-only contraceptive users. Some of these studies include      those investigating selective progesterone receptor modulators, such as mifepristone and      ulipristal acetate (UPA), which did find some benefit. Although a previous study showed mixed      benefit, the investigators feel that this medication has demonstrated both biologic      plausibility as well as clinically important outcomes. This previous study may not be      entirely translatable to the proposed research as therapies were used for different      indications (prophylaxis vs. treatment) and different progestins and delivery systems were      studied. Therefore, the investigators believe UPA should not be discounted as a potential      therapy. UPA may provide an additional safe and effective option for treatment of irregular      bleeding with implants in women. In addition, UPA is currently available in outpatient      pharmacies in the U.S. as a single 30mg oral tablet.      The investigators propose to investigate UPA for the treatment of unscheduled and troublesome      bleeding in ENG implant users.",C0184661;C0019080,C0041747;C2723461;C0009871;C0700589;C0009871;C0047683;C0033308;C0026088;C0199176;C0013227;C0033306;C0087111;C0033306;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0021102;C1555587;C0019080;C0019080;C0011209;C0019080;C0021102;C0019080;C0021102;C0021102;C0947630;C0947630;C0087111;C0021102;C0025663;C0243144;C0087136;C0947630;C0947630;C1527305;C1273517;C0013853;C1550472;C0042071;C0042071;C0042071;C0042071;C0042071;C0013853;C1555587;C4084912;C4084912;C0700651;C1706074;C0718641;C0005525;C4697740,0,195,1,0,0,0.012393834,0.008692666,0,0

NCT00673296,Intravitreal Injection of Bevacizumab and Gas for Diabetic Premacular Hemorrhage With Active Fibrovascular Proliferation,"Diabetic premacular hemorrhage occurs when blood from preretinal neovascular tissue is      entrapped between the retina and the posterior hyaloid in the macular area. It may occur      spontaneously or secondary to traction from a localized posterior vitreous detachment. This      complication may greatly disturb the central vision and may be an important stimulant of      fibrovascular proliferation.      Bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, Inc.) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which has been used to treat a variety of neovascular      ocular diseases. In proliferative diabetic retinopathy, intravitreal bevacizumab has been      shown to induce prompt regression of neovascularization and may enhance resolution of      vitreous hemorrhage.      In this study, we propose that simultaneous intravitreal injection of gas and bevacizumab may      be a useful treatment option in diabetic premacular hemorrhage with active fibrovascular      tissue. In this procedure, gas is used to displace the blood while bevacizumab may render the      neovascularization less active to decrease the likelihood of recurrent hemorrhage.",C0796392;C0019080;C1533685;C0241863;C0718247;C0596601;C0334094,C0423361;C0011884;C0042909;C0027686;C0027686;C0683525;C0334094;C0334094;C0009566;C0796392;C0796392;C0796392;C0796392;C0019080;C0746619;C0684320;C0019080;C0019080;C0027627;C0002763;C0021485;C0184661;C0241863;C0040597;C0003241;C0005847;C0012634;C0241863;C1135130;C0035298;C0042789;C0018270;C0015392;C0005767;C0947630;C0005767;C1273517;C1273517;C0596601;C0596601;C0442797;C4068891;C4068891;C0227662;C1320102;C1320102;C1514893;C0751438;C4084912,0,0,1,1,1,0.007605517,0.008358441,0,0

NCT00842049,Lumbar Drainage in Subarachnoid Haemorrhage,"Subarachnoid haemorrhage affects approximately 8000 people per year in the UK. The average      age of a patient with subarachnoid haemorrhage is 50 years, although it is often seen in      younger people (25-45 years). Despite modern medicine, the death and disability rate remains      high both from the initial bleed and from the associated complications such as vasospasm.      This is characterised by neurological impairment seen following the bleed. Despite modern      treatment this is still associated with a poor outcome. This has significant implications due      to the long term intensive neuro-rehabilitation these patients will require.      A recent study has shown that placing a small drain in the lower back following a      subarachnoid haemorrhage may reduce the chance of vasospasm occurring and result in a better      outcome. This trial was not optimally performed and so a trial is needed to look at this in      more detail. The investigators have set up such a trial in our neurosurgical unit. If the      investigators confirm that there is an improvement in patient outcome, it will change our      practice in the future.",C0013103;C0024090;C0019080;C0003707,C0038525;C0038525;C0038525;C0521654;C0034991;C0009566;C0231170;C0230102;C0085616;C0087111;C0085616;C0237607;C0750484;C0011065;C0019080;C0019080;C0947630;C0013103;C1561543;C0036849;C3245501;C3806166;C0001721;C0009566;C3844714;C1547581;C0018792;C0018792;C0018792;C0013227,0,0,1,9,9,0.007647205,0.008322906,0,0
NCT00375258,Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage,"CRASH 2 is a large pragmatic randomised placebo controlled trial of the effects of the early      administration of the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid on death, vascular events and      transfusion requirements. Adults with trauma who are within 8 hours of injury and have either      significant haemorrhage, or who are considered to be at risk of significant haemorrhage, are      eligible if the responsible doctor is for any reason substantially uncertain whether or not      to use an antifibrinolytic agent. Numbered drug or placebo packs will be available in each      participating emergency department. Randomisation will involve calling a 24-hour freecall      randomisation service.

NCT01415583,Evaluating Perioperative Dexamethasone and the Risk of Bleeding in Tonsillectomy,"Tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils) is a very common surgery in children. Bleeding after      tonsillectomy is one of the risks of this surgery and can be more dangerous in children since      they have less blood volume than adults. In order to improve recovery after tonsillectomy,      steroids (medication that is a strong anti-inflammatory) are often given during the surgery.      Recently, a study showed steroids given at the time of tonsillectomy increase the risk of      bleeding significantly over children who did not receive steroids. This finding has raised      concerns in the Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) community since most ENT's use steroids during      tonsillectomy in children. The investigators look to explore this question further.      To answer the question of whether perioperative steroid administration significantly affects      the rate of post-tonsillectomy bleeding, the investigators propose to test the following      hypotheses in a prospective, randomized, blinded placebo-controlled trial: dexamethasone does      not cause an increase in post-operative bleeding rate in tonsillectomy.",C0011777;C0040423;C0019080,C1533734;C0040423;C0040423;C0040423;C0040423;C0040423;C0040423;C0011777;C0040423;C0005850;C0013227;C0019080;C0038317;C0038317;C0019080;C0038317;C0038317;C0019080;C0019080;C0015252;C0040421;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0037088;C0038317;C0032042;C3245511;C0031354;C3244317;C0947630;C3244317;C0028429;C0392366;C0013443;C0508431;C0003209;C2004454;C0184511;C0180799;C0001721;C2911690;C1522411;C0018792;C1522634;C0030201,0,942,0,5,5,0.008922352,0.008087132,0,0

NCT00307138,Hetastarch and Bleeding Complications After Off-Pump Coronary Bypass Surgery,"There has been continuing debate about whether use of hetastarch for volume replacement in      coronary artery bypass surgery [CABG] increases the risk of postoperative bleeding. A recent      meta-analysis of hetastarch use in on-pump CABG concluded that use of hetastarch in these      procedures is associated with increased risk, but the safety of hetastarch use in off-pump      procedures remains unresolved.      We designed a double-blinded randomized clinical trial to investigate this question. The      study was designed as an equivalence trial. Statistical power calculations were performed      taking this into consideration. Sealed assignments from a block randomization table developed      prior nto initiation of the trial were unsealed in the operating room. These were used to      assign patients scheduled for off-pump CABG to receive either 1 L of hetastarch or 1 L of      albumin as part of intraoperative volume replacement. Albumin was used for all subsequent      intraoperative and postoperative fluid replacement.      The rate of postoperative bleeding was assessed prospectively by monitoring hourly chest tube      drainage and number of units of blood products transfused postoperatively in the Intensive      Care Unit. Risk was assessed by a Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) established for      this trial. The SAMC was scheduled per protocol to meet after the first 15 subjects (both      groups combined) had 1000cc or more of chest tube drainage in the first 12 hours      postoperative, and then subsequently either after 15 additional bleeds of this volume or      following a schedule set at the discretion of the DSMC.      The trial was continued until 156 patients had been recruited. At that time, 78 participants      each had been assigned to the hetastarch and albumin groups. DSMC review at that time      determined that use of hetastarch is associated with a risk of postoperative bleeding which      is greater than the risk associated with use of albumin and the DSMC accordingly halted the      trial.",C1536078;C0009566;C0020352;C0019080;C0182537;C0018787,C0010055;C0206034;C0032788;C0032788;C0032788;C0521302;C0456388;C0282458;C0518609;C0184114;C0035139;C0035139;C0020352;C0020352;C0020352;C0020352;C0589507;C0020352;C0150369;C0008034;C0150369;C0020352;C0020352;C0012621;C0442711;C0086960;C1552601;C0201838;C1552839;C0019080;C1552839;C0282443;C0947630;C0028778;C1706074;C0817096;C0182537;C0182537;C1273517;C0182537;C1273517;C1509845;C0036849;C0184661;C0184661;C0086960;C0086960;C4699158;C4082977;C1135564;C1135564;C2363670;C1328018;C0018792;C4331837;C0018792;C0018792;C0018792;C0018792;C1522634;C0600673;C1444662,0,0,0,8,8,0.006778086,0.00791083,0,0

NCT00448188,Bleeding Risk in CVCs,"Since many of the patients in an intensive care unit suffer from disorders of hemostasis,      bleeding is a main concern applying central venous catheters. Even if there are some data      indicating elevated international normalized ratio may not increase the risk of bleeding no      clear cut-off has been defined so far. An INR > 1.5 is generally considered to increase the      risk of bleeding. Furthermore, many authors consider platelets below 50 x 109 /l as a      contra-indication to CVC cannulation, since there are some data this may increase the risk of      bleeding. Therefore platelet transfusion before venous puncture is suggested. In our clinical      experience INR > 1.5 and platelets < 50 x 109 /l do not correlate with increased risk of      bleeding.

NCT03795649,The Immunomodulatory Effect of Antrifibrinolytic (Tranexamic Acid) in Total Knee Arthroplasty,"~     The administration of the tranexamic acid (TRAXA), an antifibrinolytic, blocks primary~     fibrinolysis, and thus the haemorrhage, in the early postoperative period. Significant~     surgical operations, as well as trauma, initiate a similar dynamic homeostatic mechanism~     between the creation of a clot (primary and secondary haemostasis) and its dissolution~     (fibrinolysis). Antifibrinolytics have been proven effective in reducing haemorrhage in~     patients who have undergone significant surgical operations with normal fibrinolysis, with~     the use of an appropriate surgical technique.~      A pharmacokinetic study has shown that peak fibrinolytic activity is present for 6 hours~     after the incision and it persists for 18 hours in total knee and hip arthroplasty. The~     administration of the tranexamic acid in optional orthopaedic surgery of total hip (THA) and~     knee (TKA) arthroplasty reduces the postoperative haemorrhage, as well as the number and~     volume of the postoperative autologous blood.~      A trauma in the organism triggers the immunologic response. New term has been introduced -~     the post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI), characterised by: a change on the immunologic~     cells (neutrophilia, monocytosis, increased number of mesenchymal stromal cells, reduced~     expression of HLA-DR on monocytes, reduced function of natural killer (NK) cells, increased~     lymphocyte apoptosis, a shift in homoeostasis towards the Th2 phenotype facilitated by Treg~     lymphocytes - CD4+CD25+CD127-); a change in production levels of various cytokines~     (anti-inflammatory cytokines): IL-10, IL-4; anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokine: IL-6;~     pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, TNF-a, IFN-?); the activation of the complement system (C5a~     and C3a via factor VII - tissue factor system, activated by cell damage).~      Post-traumatic immunosuppression can be made worse by transfusion, haemorrhage, stress,~     significant surgical operation and immunosuppressive drugs.~      The research has shown that Treg lymphocytes CD4+CD25+CD127- have an important role in~     controlling the acquired and innate immunity (comprising 6-8% of all CD4+ lymphocytes).~      Stopping haemorrhage prevents the occurrence of anaemia, as well as the need for transfusion~     of blood products, which lead to developing the post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI).~   ",C0003893;C0022742;C1527392,C4048329;C4048329;C4048329;C0016017;C0016017;C0016017;C0003893;C0003893;C0085702;C0015502;C0543467;C0150312;C3714660;C3714660;C1457868;C0005767;C0022742;C0022742;C0543467;C0543467;C0032788;C0035150;C4048329;C2946261;C3845829;C3845829;C1611174;C1611174;C1611174;C0019080;C0019080;C0019080;C0019080,0,0,-1,0,0,0.0081103,0.006242039,0,0

NCT02753816,TXA Study in Major Burn Surgery,"~     Major surgery can result in blood loss that can require a blood transfusion during and/or~     after surgery. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a medication that was first introduced in the 1960's~     as a treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. Over the past 20 years, it has been used and~     studied in patients undergoing open-heart surgery, liver transplantation, and urologic~     surgery. Investigators believe tranexamic acid may possibly decrease bleeding related to~     major burn surgery, resulting in reduced blood loss, lower blood transfusion rates, and~     possibly decreased hospital costs related to your stay.~      In this study, prior to each surgical procedure to treat the participants burn injury, the~     participant will receive either the drug tranexamic acid or placebo.

NCT02270242,Ticagrelor With Aspirin or Alone in High-Risk Patients After Coronary Intervention,"~     The purpose of this study is to compare the use of ticagrelor alone versus ticagrelor and~     aspirin together. Both ticagrelor and aspirin stop platelets from sticking together and~     forming a blood clot that could block blood flow to the heart. This study will look to~     determine the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor alone, compared to ticagrelor plus~     aspirin in reducing clinically relevant bleeding and in reducing ischemic adverse events~     among high-risk patients who have had a percutaneous intervention with at least one~     drug-eluting stent. A patient is considered high-risk if they meet certain clinical and/or~     anatomic criteria.~      Up to 9000 subjects will be enrolled at the time of their index PCI. Subjects meeting~     randomization eligibility criteria at 3 months post enrollment will be randomized to either~     ticagrelor plus aspirin or ticagrelor plus placebo for an additional 12 months. Follow-up~     clinic visits will be performed at 3 months, 9 months and 15 months post enrollment.~   ",C0004057;C1449882,C0302148;C0232338;C1516879;C0004057;C0004057;C0004057;C0004057;C0018787;C0918012;C1522577;C0877248;C0032042;C1516879;C1449882;C1449882;C2947996;C0022116,0,0,-1,0,0,0.002895529,0.00277409,0,0
NCT01169454,Ventriculostomy in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH): Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Open or Not?,"~     The purpose of this study is to explore two currently accepted methods of intracranial~     pressure (ICP) management through cerebral spinal fluid (CRF) drainage for patients diagnosed~     with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This is a randomized observational study of two~     physician-prescribed approaches to managing ICP monitoring and CSF drainage for SAH patients.~     The study will enroll only those patients who have ICP monitoring. Because this is an~     observational study, there are no physical risks to the patient, the only risk is loss of~     confidentiality.~   ",C0038525;C0524466,C0038525;C0025663;C0524466;C1370194,0,0,-1,8,8,0.0081103,0.002737078,0,0
NCT01382134,"Effect of Aspirin, Hemodilution and Desmopressin on Platelet Dysfunction","~     Study hypothesis: Desmopressin (DDAVP) can improve platelet function under influence of~     aspirin, hemodilution and mild hypothermia~      Mild hypothermia (34-35oC) is known to cause platelet dysfunction. This could lead to~     increased surgical bleeding and increased transfusion requirement during surgery. Although~     this hypothermia-induced platelet dysfunction seems to be reversible with warming, this is~     not always possible or desirable.~      Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a drug which has proven efficacy in improving platelet function in~     uraemic and cirrhosis patients, and in reducing blood loss in selected surgeries. In a recent~     study, we have found that subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mcg (1/10th the usual dose) is~     already sufficient to fully reverse the platelet dysfunction seen at 32oC. We have~     demonstrated in another study that prolongation of the bleeding time in a 20% hemodiluted~     sample predicts increased postoperative bleeding after total knee replacement.~      We have therefore designed this study as a follow up to our last two studies on DDAVP and~     hypothermia, to investigate whether hemodilution affects hypothermia induced platelet~     dysfunction and the response to DDAVP. In addition, another common cause of perioperative~     platelet dysfunction is the intake of COX inhibitors, particularly aspirin by patients.~     Therefor the effect of aspirin on hypothermia induced platelet dysfunction and the response~     to DDAVP, will also be investigated.~   ",C0011701;C0004057,C0011701;C0011701;C3163616;C1623038;C0332149;C0004057;C0004057;C0004057;C0701195;C0701195;C0701195;C0701195;C0701195;C0022742;C0184511;C0020674;C0020674;C0586328,0,0,-1,3,3,0.002895529,0.002576751,0,0
