NCT02648061,Transitions Between Clinical Circulatory States After Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest,"Extensive research exists for cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the chance of      successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is improved. Unfortunately, the overall      prognosis after ROSC has not improved much and the in-hospital mortality is still reported to      be 50 to 70 %. The ""post-resuscitation disease"" is now called the ""post-cardiac arrest      syndrome"" (PCAS) and comprises 1) brain injury, 2) myocardial dysfunction and 3) systemic      ischemia and reperfusion.      Treatment of patients after cardiac arrest has often followed guidelines that were primarily      developed for treatment of septic shock. It is still uncertain whether this is the optimal      way to deliver circulatory support after cardiac arrest.

NCT01082991,Patient Acuity Rating: a Tool to Prevent In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of medical personnel in their ability      to predict the likelihood of non-intensive care (ICU), ward patients to clinically      deteriorate (defined as a cardiac arrest, unplanned ICU transfer, or unexpected death)via the      use of a clinical judgement-based tool designed for this study, Patient Acuity Rating (PAR),      to predict short-term clinical deterioration. We will compare the ability of this tool to      predict clinical deterioration compared to accepted physiology-based tools and tools      combining judgment and physiology as well as other markers of deterioration such as physician      order changes. We will compare the sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve of these      combined models to the predictive models including only physiology or clinical judgment. We      will assess the correlation between specific physician orders and patient deterioration to      determine whether specific clinical activities, such as emergently obtained radiology exams,      predict impending deterioration. We hypothesize that PAR will be a useful tool for predicting      clinical deterioration across the institution and that it will have a higher average accuracy      for predicting clinical deterioration in non-ICU inpatients within 24 hours than the      physiology-based tools alone. We further hypothesize that a combined metric which includes      both the PAR and the individual physiologic components that comprise physiologic tools will      not significantly improve prediction over the PAR alone. We further propose to use PAR to      prospectively risk stratify patients for preemptive evaluation by the Rapid Response Team.

NCT01789554,The Use of Mobile Phones in Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest to Increase Bystander CPR,"Death from cardiac disease is one of the most common causes of death in the western world.      The majority of these deaths takes place outside hospital as sudden cardiac death. However,      with immediate (within minutes) actions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and      defibrillation many lives would be saved. CPR is a key factor to increase survival from Out      of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA). CPR buys time by supporting the brain with some      circulation in waiting for a defibrillator that can restart the heart. In Sweden about 2,5      million people are trained in CPR. However, only about half of all OHCA victims will get CPR      in waiting for ambulance arrival.      The aims of the Response to Urgent Mobile message for Bystander Activation (RUMBA) trial is      to try a new way of logistics to increase bystander CPR by recruiting lay volunteers to      nearby OHCAs via their mobile phones.

NCT00901134,Multicenter Registry Study With Therapeutic Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest in Japan,"Recently, early defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for sudden onset of      cardiac arrest are advancing, however, survival rate is still very low in the world.      Furthermore, post-cardiac arrest brain injury is a common cause of morbidity and mortality      after successful resuscitation which is urgent issue to be solved. Therapeutic hypothermia is      part of a standardized treatment strategy for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest in the      metabolic phase usually about 15 minutes after cardiac arrest. However, the evidences of the      efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia are still few. The optimal candidates, temperature, the      timing of initiation, the therapeutic windows and the rate for rewarming have not been      defined clinically and should be established.

Recent studies have showed that      the high quality of CPR increases the survival after cardiac arrest. Therefore the      investigators planned this prospective observational study to determine the epidemiology of      sudden cardiac arrest in the prehospital setting of Tampere area, the quality of the CPR, and      also the associations between depth and frequency of chest compressions and invasive arterial      pressure, EtCO2,cerebral oxygenation and iatrogenic injuries associated to chest compressions      1) in patients resuscitated out of hospital by emergency medical service's (EMS's) personals      and 2) in-hospital by hospital resuscitation team members. In addition, the investigators      will analyze the effects of the chosen method of resuscitation on critical vital signs (Etco2      and invasive pressures): closed-chest CPR is compared to open-chest CPR, or mechanical CPR      with a device (AutoPulse-CPR, Cardio Pump) compared to manual CPR guided with quality CPR      device. The results will give the investigators important insights into the haemodynamics of      CPR which may guide future strategies for the management of cardiac arrest.

NCT02231060,Study for the Improvement of Long-Term Outcome Prediction in Patients in Coma After Cardiac Arrest,The primary objective of HOPE is to improve the accuracy of outcome prediction in      anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy following cardiac arrest by bringing under close scrutiny some      of the existing methods used for this purpose (e.g. somato-sensory evoked potentials). HOPE      is the first multicenter prospective cohort study on coma prognosis to control for the effect      of a possible self-fulfilling prophecy at the ICU and to cover the acute and      neurorehabilitation phases with a long-term follow-up longer than the usual three or six      months.,C0018790;C0947630;C0233324;C0009421;C1550655,C0007786;C0033325;C0561862;C0018790;C0018017;C0033325;C0332149;C0025663;C1518681;C0947630;C0392347;C1273517;C0392347;C0009421;C1551994;C0204096;C0184511;C0183210;C0871323;C1561542;C0068451,0,0,1,0,0,0.015944159,0.014455197,0,0

We hypothesize that the automatic, rapid, accurate and specific diagnostic and therapeutic      technology used in AECDs will further increase the rate of survival in patients with cardiac      arrest through rapid and automatic defibrillation, independent of operator initiation, as      compared to standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation initiated by healthcare providers.",C0013778;C0018790;C0150369;C1548801,C0007203;C0553534;C0180307;C0013778;C0035273;C0180307;C0003811;C1290940;C0087111;C0589507;C0086388;C0332167;C0039451;C0205161;C0184666;C1552740;C2828392;C0871269;C0018787;C0018790;C0018787;C1273517;C0087111;C1555587;C0011900;C1548801;C1705273,20,1152,0,0,0,0.013229853,0.013600002,0,0

NCT01969149,Exenatide for Stress Hyperglycemia,"~     Stress hyperglycemia is a common phenomenon in cardiac surgery that concerns diabetic and non~     diabetic patients.~      It has been shown that perioperative hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor of~     postoperative mortality and morbidity.~      The Leuven et al.'s study suggested that strict glycemic perioperative control using an~     intensive insulin therapy could reduce mortality and morbidity in surgical intensive care's~     patients. This study included a majority of cardiac surgery patients. Others studies have~     suggested that the beneficial effect of insulin-based tight perioperative glycemic control~     might be hampered by iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Moreover, insulin therapy failed to obtain~     perioperative glycemic stability in most patients.~      Exenatide (Byetta ?) is an incretin mimetic, characterized by an anti-hyperglycemic effect~     that depends on the blood glucose level.~      We hypothesize that continuous intravenous infusion of exenatide could improve perioperative~     glycemic control and stability and could reduce the risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia compared~     to a conventional insulin therapy during the perioperative period of cardiac surgery.~   ",C0020456;C0038435,C1511497;C0020456;C0020456;C0020615;C0020615;C0021641;C0021641;C0021641;C0017725;C0021641;C0038435;C0005767;C0035648;C1562292;C0020456;C0184511;C0085559;C1444783;C1444783;C0011546;C0946279,0,0,-1,5,5,0.004637739,0.005690846,0,0
