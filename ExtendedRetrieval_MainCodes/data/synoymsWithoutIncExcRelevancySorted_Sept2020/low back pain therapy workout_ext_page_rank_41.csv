NCT00256373,Treatment of Chronic Low Back Pain: A Trial Comparing Traditional Back School and Individual Therapist-Assisted Exercise,"Rheumatologists are discussing, whether rehabilitation of patients with low back pain (LBP)      can be improved. At present patients with LBP start treatment as soon as possible, this also      applies for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) - pain lasting over 12 weeks. At      Glostrup University Hospital department of Physical Medicine/rheumatology we use a method      (method A) where an interdisciplinary team gives the patients a treatment composed of various      topics. This includes among other things education, physical team training, exercises in      swimming pool, stretching exercises, and occupational therapy. A different method (method B)      originates from the Rehabilitation centre in Karlslunde led by Teddy Oefeldt. Here they focus      strictly on dynamic training of muscles in the back and the buttocks. A therapist, who in the      beginning partly carries the patient through the exercises, assists this training.      In both methods, individually considerations are taken, but to a greater extend in method B.      The treatment will extend over a three months period.      A few earlier investigations have compared these two methods, but they have not been      systematized to such a degree, that they gave any final conclusions. Therefore, we      initialized an investigation including a larger number of patients, where the two methods are      compared from the results the patients achieve after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.      286 consecutive patients were included and randomized to one of the two methods. Those, who      did not wish to participate in the investigation, were treated according to the department’s      normal procedure (Method A)",C0024031;C0087111;C1522704;C1547296;C0004600,C0457949;C0600080;C1318464;C0034991;C0034991;C0518609;C0024031;C1552578;C1552578;C0087111;C0087111;C0424927;C0452240;C0452240;C0087111;C0184661;C0184511;C0332149;C0031809;C0013227;C0006497;C0150312;C3540008;C0699809;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C0025344;C0542560;C1553386;C0025663;C1552850;C0030193;C0004600;C1552578;C2360800;C0442694;C0442694;C0442694;C3843676;C0557034;C1170317;C1170317;C1555712;C1561542;C1561542;C0031809;C3242287;C0332155,0,0,1,8,8,0.025926373,0.026999901,2,3

NCT03221439,Cognitive Functional Therapy for Chronic Low Back Pain,"~     There is evidence, of a single randomized controlled trial, that CFT is better than combined~     manual therapy and motor control exercise for chronic low back pain. However, this study had~     significant methodological shortcomings regarding the failure to carry out the intention to~     treat analysis and a considerable loss of follow-up of patients. It is important to replicate~     this study through a randomized clinical trial with similar objectives in another domain, but~     correcting these methodological shortcomings. Therefore, the aim of the study is to assess~     the efficacy of Cognitive Functional Therapy in patients with chronic non specific low back~     pain.~   ",C0024031;C0392335,C0024031;C2948600;C0392335;C0723338;C0454525;C0282440,0,0,1,0,0,0.02515352,0.021179417,1,3

NCT02241538,Effectiveness of Different Weekly Frequency of Modified Pilates Method Exercises in the Treatment of Chronic Nonspecific Low Back Pain,"Low back pain is a major cause of disability and absenteeism and the supervised exercise is a      recommended treatment by the guidelines and has been cost-effective. Currently, the Pilates      method has shown to be effective in improving pain and disability in patients with chronic      low back pain (CLBP). However, there is still no evidence about the ideal number of sessions      for the treatment and the interval between sessions to achieve better efficacy of this method      for these patients. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the      Pilates method with different weekly frequency of sessions in the treatment of patients with      nonspecific CLBP. Investigators will assess 296 patients of both genders, with nonspecific      CLBP lasting more than three months and aged between 18 and 80 years. Participants will be      randomly divided into four groups (n = 74 patients per group): Control Group will receive an      educational booklet and no additional exercise, Pilates 1 Group will receive a program of      exercises based on Pilates method once a week for six weeks, Pilates 2 Group will receive the      same program of exercises twice a week for six weeks and Pilates 3 Group will receive the      same program of exercises three times a week for six weeks. The outcomes overall disability      (Roland Morris Disability questionnaire), specific disability (Patient-Specific Functional      scale), kinesiophobia (Tampa scale for kinesiophobia), pain intensity (Pain Numerical Rating      scale) and global perceived effect (Global Perceived Effect scale) will be assessed by a      blinded assessor before, six weeks, six and 12 months after randomization. Investigators      expect that the largest number of weekly sessions of Pilates method may influence the results      in all analyzes (short, medium and long term), since there is a relationship between      frequency of exercises and effect size of the treatment.",C4553491;C0024031;C2347273;C0452240;C0087111;C1547296;C0025663,C1320357;C0024031;C0024031;C4553491;C0034394;C0231170;C0162791;C0231170;C0231170;C0231170;C0231170;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0452240;C0452240;C0452240;C0030971;C0030971;C0452240;C0087111;C1552740;C0030258;C1550655;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C1552839;C0025663;C1518681;C0025663;C1518681;C0947630;C1561557;C1561557;C1561557;C1561557;C0175659;C0175659;C0175659;C0175659;C0030193;C1561540;C1561540;C1561540;C0030193;C4699604;C0452240;C0452240;C0424927;C1705273;C2347273;C2347273;C0233697;C0233697;C0233697;C0233697;C1561542;C1552839;C1552654;C1552740;C1564718,0,0,1,0,0,0.025747143,0.02750952,2,2

Current treatments for low back pain in the emergency department      generally include pills or injections of medications to treat pain and relax muscles.      However, it is known that many of these medications have risks and toxicities which may limit      their safe use in some patients. Therefore, new types of treatments are needed.      Acupuncture is an ancient form of healing that has been practiced in some form for centuries.

NCT02323412,Antibiotics In Modic Changes,"~     Low-back pain (LBP) is the single leading cause for disability worldwide, affects all age~     groups and has increased from 58 million years lived with disability (YLDs) in 1990 to 83~     million YLDs in 2010. The burden is accordingly substantially higher than previously~     assessed, causing activity limitation and work absence with subsequently enormous economic~     burden. Norwegian expenses reach at least NOK 24 billions annually whereof a substantial part~     is hospital costs. The research project responds to this challenge and aim to conduct a~     multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial, complemented by a study of epigenetic and~     molecular biomarkers, to re-examine the finding of a recent randomized controlled trial that~     antibiotic treatment can cure patients with chronic low back pain (LBP), a former disc~     herniation and present Modic Changes (MCs). The hypothesis is that MCs is caused by low~     virulent anaerobic organisms in the disc. Investigators also want to add important new~     knowledge to the research field beyond the only former RCT by broadening the inclusion~     criteria to include both patients with type I and type II MCs, improving the MRI assessment~     of MCs, further clarifying the pathogenesis of MCs by studying genetic variability, gene and~     protein expression of inflammatory biomarkers, and conducting health economic analysis.~   ",C0003232,C0024031;C0699748;C0805586;C0376554;C0243095;C0150312;C0030193;C2948600;C0003232;C0032042;C0332128;C0723338;C0033621;C0282440;C0180112;C0376495,0,0,-1,5,5,0.025510204,0.022840836,0,0

NCT00802724,Classification-Directed Treatment of Low Back Pain,"The primary purpose of this proposal is to conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled      clinical trial to examine whether or not treatment based on a person's direction-specific,      impairment-based LBP classification is more effective than Non-specific treatment in      improving short- (6 weeks) and long-term (6 and 12 months) outcomes in people with chronic      LBP. We hypothesize that treatment based on a person's direction-specific, impairment-based      LBP classification (Classification-specific) will result in better outcomes than Non-specific      treatment. Our approach to classification-directed treatment is based on the proposal that a      person's LBP is the result of adopting direction-specific strategies of movement and      alignment of the spine which then are used repeatedly during the person's everyday      activities. The exposure of spine tissue to repeated loading in the same direction across a      day is proposed to accelerate the accumulation of stress, microtrauma, and eventually LBP. We      also hypothesize that until the factors contributing to the use of the direction-specific      strategies of the spine are modified, the LBP problem will persist or recur. Identification      of homogeneous subgroups of people with LBP will enhance 1) the power of clinical trials, 2)      prognosis, and 3) the ability to identify mechanisms contributing to different LBP problems.",C0024031;C0087111;C4522152;C0475455,C1096775;C1096775;C0020792;C1313880;C0684336;C0684336;C0679199;C0679199;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0033325;C1948033;C1552740;C1552740;C1552740;C1552740;C1552740;C1948033;C0425382;C1552740;C0274281;C1552740;C0033213;C0038435;C0037949;C0037949;C0037949;C1273517;C1561538;C4699604;C0475455;C0033213;C0000589;C4055506;C2911690;C0441606;C0522247;C0681111;C0681111;C0681111;C3858576;C4522152;C0026649,0,0,0,7,3.5,0.025156573,0.016682489,0,0

NCT01345409,Acupuncture and Chiropractic Care for Chronic Pain in an Integrated Health Plan,"~     Recent research examines many types of complementary and alternative (CAM) therapies.~     However, real-world use of CAM has been largely overlooked.~      This project consists of four discrete sets of project activities (that largely follow one~     another chronologically).~      Phase1 uses information from the EMR (patient electronic medical records) to identify unique~     clusters of patients with CMP (chronic musculoskeletal pain), their care within the health~     plan, and to examine how those in unique clusters may have different uses for A/C~     (acupuncture and chiropractic) services and/or differential outcomes associated with such~     care.~      Phase 2 will conduct a survey of CMP patients from KPNW (Kaiser Permanente Northwest region)~     to establish a broad sample of patients and their use of out-of-plan CAM services.~      Phase 3 will collect qualitative data (focus groups and individual interviews) from KP~     members, KP providers, and acupuncturists and chiropractors from the community to examine KP~     providers' decision to recommend A/C services, A/C services delivered to KP patients, and~     patients' decisions to pursue and retain CAM care. A secondary purpose is to have KP members~     with CMP review planned assessment instruments to improve understandability of the~     instruments. They will provide feedback on: relevancy, any notable omissions of domains~     important in patients' decision to use CAM services for pain treatment. They will also~     provide insight to broader health and quality of life outcomes associated with such CAM~     treatments.~      Phase 4 is a prospective cohort study to evaluate health services/costs and broader clinical~     and functional outcomes associated with the receipt of A/C relative to carefully matched~     comparison participants receiving traditional CMP services.~   ",C0150055,C0025102;C0679006;C0679006;C0233820;C0030193;C0030193;C0679006;C0332128;C0332128;C0184511;C0038951;C0695630;C1148475;C0332128;C0376495,0,0,-1,27,13.5,0.025510204,0.014073075,0,0
