NCT02205931,Ketogenic Diet in Infants With Epilepsy (KIWE),"~     Epilepsy, a condition where individuals are prone to recurrent epileptic seizures, is the~     most common chronic neurological disorder in children. Epilepsy onset is most common in the~     first two years of life and is associated with poor prognosis for seizure control and~     neurodevelopmental outcome.~      The ketogenic diet (KD) is a medically supervised diet that is high in fat and restricted in~     carbohydrates and protein. KD therapy has shown to be an effective treatment for seizures in~     children with epilepsy older than two. Associated benefits include: a reduced requirement for~     routine and emergency antiepileptic drugs (AED) and fewer seizure related hospital~     admissions. Although reports suggest that KD therapy improves seizures in younger children~     there is no high quality trial data that demonstrates effectiveness and safety in this age~     group. The KD is resource intensive, requiring dietetic and physician time; data is required~     to justify expansion of services to cater for the apparent need.~      The investigators therefore propose a prospective multicentre randomised trial to investigate~     the effectiveness and safety of the KD in children with epilepsy under the age of 2, who have~     failed to respond to two or more AEDs. Children will be randomly assigned to either receive~     the KD or further AEDs. The allocated treatment will be started after a 2week baseline~     period, and it's effectiveness assessed after 8 weeks. Seizure diaries will be used to record~     seizures and related events, a questionnaire will be used to assess diet tolerance; also~     growth and blood biochemistry will be monitored.~      The information obtained from this study is necessary to optimise choices in epilepsy~     treatment, aiming to improve outcomes and thus determine whether and when the KD should~     should be used.~   ",C0259972;C0014544,C0259972;C0014544;C0036572;C0014544;C0036572;C0014544;C0036572;C0014544;C0036572;C0036572;C0036572;C0036572;C0018270;C3687832;C0005767;C0034394;C0014544;C0184511;C0684224;C0184511;C0033621;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495,0,0,1,0,0,0.058541488,0.051121662,2,5
NCT00836836,Modified Atkins Diet in Childhood Epilepsy,"~     Seizures are a frequent cause of morbidity in the pediatric age group. Uncontrolled seizures~     pose a variety of risks to children, including higher rates of mortality, developmental delay~     and/or regression, and cognitive impairment. The ketogenic diet is a well known treatment~     option for refractory epilepsy. However it is very restrictive and requires strict weighing~     of foods. The modified Atkins diet is a dietary therapy for intractable childhood epilepsy~     that was designed to be a less restrictive alternative to the traditional ketogenic diet.~     Early studies have demonstrated efficacy and safety.There are no randomized trials evaluating~     the efficacy of the modified Atkins diet in children with refractory epilepsy. Hence this~     study has been planned to investigate whether there are clear benefits in terms of seizure~     control in children with refractory epilepsy who are treated with the modified Atkins diet,~     versus controls.~   ",C0014544,C0259972;C0684321;C0036572;C0014544;C0014544;C0014544;C0259972;C0036572;C0014544;C0036572,0,0,1,28,28,0.083793033,0.062693569,2,4
NCT02100501,Prospective Study of Comparison Between the Modified Atkins Diet and Classic Ketogenic Diet for Intractable Childhood Epilepsy,"~     The Ketogenic diet is a now proven, evidence based treatment of refractory epilepsy. the~     classic ketogenic diet (KD) is based on a ratio of fat to carbohydrate and protein, usually~     3:1 or 4:1. Fat is proven long-chain triglycerides. The efficacy of the KD has been proven by~     many multicenter trials. But, side effects of ketogenic diet therapy is severe. The modified~     atkins diet (MAD) was designed and investigated at Johns Hopkins Hospital, which aimed to~     propose a less restrictive dietary treatment that would be more palatable to children and~     adolescents with less side effects. The MAD consist of a nearly balance diet (60% fat, 30%~     protein, and 10% carbohydrates by weight), without any restriction on the recommended daily~     calories. Some literature suggested that the MAD is an effective treatment for refractory~     epilepsy. But, no randomised controlled study has been tried. the investigators aimed in this~     prospective study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of MAD comparing to KD.~     The patients were recruited between age 3 to 18 years old with intractable epilepsy. Enrolled~     patients were randomly assigned to either one of two groups; the KD group and MAD group. The~     patients were required to attend outpatient clinic after 1, 3month to record their seizure~     frequency and severity, while their dietary treatment.~   ",C0259972;C0014544,C0259972;C0259972;C0259972;C0023866;C0014544;C0014544;C0014544;C0014653;C3888388;C0036572;C0034869;C0017860;C0033621;C0033621;C0180112;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495,0,0,1,18,18,0.058541488,0.049892729,2,4

NCT03052998,Ivermectin Treatment in Patients With Onchocerciasis-associated Epilepsy,"Many studies have reported an association between epilepsy, including Nodding Syndrome (NS),      and onchocerciasis (river blindness). A high prevalence of epilepsy has been noted      particularly in onchocerciasis hyperendemic areas where onchocerciasis is not or      insufficiently controlled with mass Ivermectin distribution. There is evidence that      increasing the coverage of Ivermectin reduces the incidence of epilepsy and anecdotal      evidence suggests a reduction in seizure frequency in onchocerciasis associated epilepsy      (OAE) patients who receive Ivermectin. Finding an alternative treatment for epilepsy in these      patients will have major consequences.      Objective      To assess whether Ivermectin treatment decreases the frequency of seizures and leads to      seizure freedom in OAE patients, including patients with NS. If we are able to demonstrate      such an effect this would be an extra argument that Onchocerciasis is causing epilepsy and      that therefore we should increase our efforts to eliminate onchocerciasis.      Methods      We will conduct a randomized clinical trial in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to      compare seizure freedom in onchocerciasis infested epilepsy patients who receive immediate      Ivermectin treatment with delayed (after four months) Ivermectin treatment. All participants      will simultaneously receive anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) according to local guidelines for      epilepsy treatment. The primary endpoint is seizure freedom defined as no seizures during the      fourth month of follow-up. Secondary endpoint is significant (>50%) seizure reduction      compared to baseline seizure frequency. Reduction of seizures will be compared between      Ivermectin and non-Ivermectin arms.      Current status      Start of enrolment is planned from March 2017 and we expect to have enrolled all 110      participants by August 2017. Results are expected early 2018.      Discussion      If Ivermectin treatment, in addition to AEDs, is able to lead to seizure freedom or      significantly reduces seizure frequency in OAE patients this will have major consequences for      epilepsy treatment in Onchocerciasis endemic regions. Ivermectin is donated for free, and in      non Loa-Loa endemic regions has negligible side effects. Reducing the burden of epilepsy will      have a major impact on quality of life and socio-economic status of families with affected      members in Africa.",C0029001;C0022322;C0087111;C0014544;C1550655,C0206034;C0149775;C0149775;C0149775;C3658353;C2986535;C0029002;C0518214;C0029001;C0029001;C0029001;C0029001;C0029001;C0029001;C0029001;C0029001;C0877248;C0004083;C0022322;C0022322;C0022322;C0022322;C0022322;C0022322;C0162791;C0022322;C0022322;C0022322;C0022322;C4551656;C0087111;C0018017;C0087111;C1697779;C0087111;C0087111;C0014544;C0087111;C4551656;C1293152;C0087111;C0087111;C0700287;C0014544;C0014544;C3854012;C0014544;C0014544;C0014544;C0036572;C0014544;C0014544;C0014544;C0036572;C0036572;C4684790;C0014544;C0014544;C0947630;C0037088;C0036572;C0025663;C0036572;C0036572;C0036572;C0036572;C1518681;C0013227;C1561542;C0577559;C1299581;C0446516;C1299581;C1442948;C1378698;C0015264;C4684637;C2825142;C2911690;C0557061;C3166194;C0442797;C2347273;C0027627;C4055646;C1561542;C1328018;C1101725;C0221106;C0204742;C0728774;C4698437;C0034770,0,0,0,3,3,0.045865306,0.04996797,2,2

NCT02178995,Methylphenidate Treatment of Attention Deficits in Epilepsy,"Methylphenidate (MPH) has long been used to improve attention and cognitive difficulties      associated with ADHD, including in children with ADHD and epilepsy (Torres et al., 2008).      Methylphenidate (MPH) is also helpful in treating attention and other cognitive difficulties      in a variety of other neurological and medical conditions (Kajs-Wyllie, 2002; Prommer, 2012).      We seek to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of this medication in treating      attention deficits, as well as other cognitive difficulties, experienced by adult patients      with epilepsy.      To our knowledge, there are currently very few studies which explicitly examine the impact of      MPH on measureable attention deficits and other cognitive deficits in adult patients with      epilepsy. We hope to quantify what impact, if any, methylphenidate has on attention, in      addition to other specific measureable cognitive functions, in patients with cognitive      complaints and epilepsy, and contribute to a growing body of evidence which supports the      safety of methylphenidate's use for attention deficits in patients with epilepsy.

The goal of the~     surveys is to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational plan as specified in the European~     Risk Management Plan (RMP).~      The objectives of this study are to assess patients' and prescribers' understanding and~     knowledge of the significant risks associated with Trobalt?? use as evaluated by a survey~     instrument.~      This is a cross sectional survey of:~        1. 250 patients recruited from across the following countries (United Kingdom, Sweden,~          Denmark, Switzerland, Spain, Slovakia and Norway) and up to 100 patients from Germany~          who are currently using or have filled a prescription for Trobalt?? at least once in the~          last 3 months.~        2. 200 neurologists who have prescribed an anti-epileptic drug (AED) at least once in the~          last 3 months, and who were on the list to which a letter containing the Physician's~          Guide for Trobalt?? was distributed from across the following countries (United Kingdom,~          Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Spain, Slovakia and Norway). At least 75 of the~          neurologists will have prescribed Trobalt??. The survey will also aim to include up to~          100 neurologists from Germany of which approximately 50 will have prescribed Trobalt??.~      Patients eligible for the survey will be asked to take the survey online or via a telephone~     interview if the latter is preferred. Neurologists will be invited to take the survey online.~      The selected countries were the first five countries to launch Trobalt?? (Germany, Denmark,~     United Kingdom, Switzerland and Sweden) and an additional three countries with launch in~     2011, but with relatively high rates of uptake of Trobalt?? (Spain, Slovakia and Norway). The~     selection of countries includes Switzerland, which is not part of the European Union.~     However, the key messages regarding the risks with Trobalt?? are in alignment. The rationale~     for surveying the first five countries to launch is so that any issues identified from these~     countries regarding the effectiveness of the Physician's Guide and PIL in communicating the~     risks of Trobalt?? can be addressed as soon as possible, and the key messages can be revised~     in a timely manner. In addition, these countries are likely to provide the greatest number of~     neurologists with experience of prescribing Trobalt??, and their patients.~      The primary outcome of the survey is the proportion of patients/neurologists providing~     correct responses to a series of questions concerning the significant risks associated with~     Trobalt??. The risks evaluated will be those described in the Trobalt?? PIL and in the~     Physician's Guide.~   ",C0038951,C1955348;C0596545;C0376554;C0332149;C3273178;C0038951;C0243144;C0745732;C2948600;C0038951;C0038951;C0038951;C0038951;C0038951;C0038951;C0038951;C0600091;C0678257;C1442065,0,0,1,1,1,0.05,0.033233424,0,0
