NCT00286767,Immune Reconstitution Syndrome in HIV-Infected Patients Taking Antiretroviral Therapy,"This study will investigate what factors may lead to the development of immune reconstitution      syndrome (IRIS) in HIV-infected patients and what the outcome is after IRIS. It will also      seek to better define and describe the syndrome. IRIS is a condition that can occur in      HIV-infected people following the start of antiretroviral therapy. The sudden improvement of      immune function with this therapy can cause an unexpected worsening of diseases the patient      already has, such as tuberculosis or fungal infections, and development of fever, enlarged      lymph nodes or other complications, or even uncover a previously silent disease.      HIV-infected people who are at least 18 years old, whose CD4+T cell count is 100 cells per      microliter or less, and who have not previously been treated with combination antiretroviral      therapy or have taken the drugs for less than 3 months and more than 6 months before      screening for this study may be eligible to participate. Candindates must also live within      the wider DC area so that acute problems after therapy initiation will be evaluated at NIH.      Candidates are evaluated before starting therapy with a medical history and physical      examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray and CT scan of the chest,      tuberculin skin testing, apheresis, and possibly an intestinal (gut) and lymph node biopsy      (surgical removal of a small piece of tissue for microscopic examination). For apheresis,      blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and spun in a machine that separates the      blood components. The white blood cells and plasma are removed, and the red cells and      platelets are returned through the same needle or through a needle in a vein in the other      arm.      Participants have a complete history and physical examination and additional blood tests,      including genetic studies, upon entering the study. They start taking anti-HIV medications,      prescribed according to the current standard of care, as well as medications to treat other      infections, and treatment of IRIS, if needed. The study lasts about 4 years. Patients return      to the clinic at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the entry visit, then every 12 weeks (about every      3 months) until week 48 (the first year), and then every 16 weeks (about every 4 months)      until the end of the study. At most visits, patients have a medical history, physical      examination and blood and urine tests, including CD4+T cell count and HIV plasma viral load      measurement. Apheresis is also done at weeks 24 and 48 and then once every 48 weeks.      Intestinal and lymph node biopsies (optional) are also done at weeks 24 and 48. A syphilis      test and PAP smear (for women) are done yearly. and plasma, cells and serum are stored at      almost every visit for immunologic studies.",C1619738;C1963724;C0439663;C1550655,C0150618;C0026018;C1963724;C0026946;C0013798;C0193842;C0015252;C0085430;C2936643;C0262926;C0262926;C0009566;C0041296;C0037296;C0243107;C0243107;C0024204;C0031809;C1263430;C0039985;C0018941;C0013227;C0013227;C0031809;C1263430;C0007584;C0589507;C0041289;C0021853;C0278329;C3714514;C0007584;C0376705;C0021853;C0024204;C0012634;C0199230;C0005791;C0005791;C0087111;C0005791;C0039082;C0439663;C0039082;C0439663;C0031843;C0012634;C0439663;C0226792;C0005558;C0039128;C0087111;C0012634;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0040405;C0947630;C0947630;C0439662;C4684637;C0439662;C0027551;C0032105;C0027551;C0027551;C0032105;C0032105;C0947630;C1552850;C0015967;C0013227;C0947630;C0005767;C0817096;C0005767;C0005767;C0947630;C1552850;C0947630;C1512346;C0947630;C0005767;C0444186;C0229671;C1512346;C1442948;C0022077;C0022077;C0022077;C0042449;C0022077;C1561540;C1561543;C0392366;C0699819;C0446516;C3539181;C0935444;C0033213;C1550655;C4055646;C0311392;C3844714;C0202165;C0220825;C0220825;C0086972;C0032181;C3843399;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1512346;C0523113;C3843322;C1521740;C4699275;C1293134;C0332149;C4283785;C0031809;C3843408;C0332155,,,1,103.0,51.5,0.0232018189394546,0.021746949139269705

NCT00851799,"Impact of Antiretroviral Therapy on Metabolic, Skeletal, and Cardiovascular Parameters","The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) guidelines recommend that HIV-infected      people who have never received anti-HIV therapy be treated with a triple drug regimen      (commonly called combination antiretroviral therapy, cART). Since the introduction of cART,      morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients has been dramatically reduced. However,      metabolic, skeletal, and cardiovascular diseases have been increasingly reported among      HIV-infected patients and may be attributable, in part, to the direct effects of cART. Much      of our understanding of the development of these diseases, risk factors, and consequences of      these disorders has been derived from clinical studies of HIV-infected persons receiving      older antiretroviral agents.      A5260s was designed to examine the contributions of HIV-disease related factors and impact of      newer antiretroviral drugs on the development of metabolic (such as blood vessels, blood      sugar, cholesterol), skeletal, and cardiovascular diseases in people who have never received      anti-HIV therapy. A5260s is a prospective substudy of a phase III randomized clinical trial      A5257 (see ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00811954). A5257 was designed to look at      different combinations of anti-HIV drugs that do not contain the medication efavirenz (EFV)      and how well these drug combinations work to decrease the amount of HIV in the blood and to      allow immune system recovery in people who have never received anti-HIV therapy. A5257 also      examined drug tolerability and safety for the various drug combinations.",C1963724;C3887460;C2707259;C2827715,C0206034;C0007222;C0007222;C1963724;C0599685;C4086204;C0013162;C0013162;C1510425;C1510425;C1510425;C0162340;C0005847;C0596130;C0035648;C3539181;C0243107;C0243107;C0162791;C0600091;C0013227;C0220880;C0012634;C0674428;C1704289;C0439663;C0439663;C0700287;C0439663;C0012634;C0439663;C0332128;C0040808;C0947630;C0012634;C3540008;C3244286;C0439662;C0013227;C0005767;C0242209;C0013227;C0005767;C0013227;C4281574;C0013227;C0042789;C3539181;C0442797;C0376495;C2004454;C0000589;C4684765;C0201950;C1518681;C0233492;C1328956;C2707259;C2707259;C0449878;C1555709;C1254223;C4086490;C3272565;C4086490;C4086490;C0332155,0.0,0.0,1,83.0,27.6666666666667,0.011303295801902261,0.019508647741082484

NCT00013611,Interleukin-2 Plus Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-Infected Patients With Low CD4+ Counts (SILCAAT Study),"This study will examine whether interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus antiretroviral therapy (ART) slows      HIV disease progression in patients with low CD4+ T cell counts compared with patients taking      ART alone. CD4+ T cells are a subset of lymphocytes-white blood cells that are part of the      body's immune system. IL-2 is a protein that is naturally produced by lymphocytes. Given in      intermittent cycles, IL-2 can raise CD4+ T cell counts in some HIV-infected patients taking      antiretroviral drugs. This study will examine whether the increase in CD4+ T cells lowers the      risk of AIDS-related illnesses and death.      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with a viral load under 10,000 copies per      milliliter and a CD4+ T cell count between 50 and 299 cells per cubic millimeter who are      taking antiretroviral therapy and who have not previously received IL-2 therapy may be      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical      examination, and blood and urine tests. Participation in the study will be from 4.5 to 6      years, depending on what point in the duration of the study the individual patient is      enrolled.      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive IL-2 plus ART or ART alone. All participants      will be advised individually about the best ART regimen for them. Patients in the IL-2      treatment group will be taught how to self-inject IL-2 under the skin (similar to insulin      injections). They will inject IL-2 twice a day for 5 days every 8 weeks for the first year      (until week 49 of the study). From week 49 on they may receive 5-day cycles of IL-2 every 4      months when needed to maintain CD4+ T cell count elevations. An extra cycle may be given 2      months after the week 49 follow-up visit (see follow-up schedule below), depending on their      CD4+ T cell count. Patients whose cell counts have not increased after 12 to 16 months of      IL-2 treatment will discuss with the doctor the possibility of stopping IL-2. Those who do      stop IL-2 treatment will be asked to remain in the study for follow-up evaluations.      All patients will be followed in the clinic every 2 months for the first year of the study      (weeks 1, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41 and 49) and every 4 months during years 2-6 for a brief history      and physical exam, urine and blood tests, return of diary cards (record of drug side effects)      and medication review. During the visits from the second year on, patients will also be asked      about their ability to do certain ordinary tasks, such as taking care of themselves; ...",C1963724;C1522405;C0243009;C0439663;C0947630;C4321351;C1550655,C1963724;C1963724;C0242656;C0041755;C0560023;C0262926;C0589121;C1522405;C0031809;C0007584;C0007584;C0031809;C1263430;C0007584;C0220825;C0018941;C0376705;C0007584;C0021485;C0007584;C0007584;C0221423;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0439663;C0439663;C4684790;C1552601;C0086960;C0723457;C0087111;C0040808;C0021641;C0262512;C0439662;C0034869;C0947630;C0439044;C0005767;C0013227;C0947630;C0011065;C0947630;C0005767;C0947630;C0947630;C0439044;C0947630;C3244317;C0947630;C0947630;C0042036;C0376660;C1551994;C1561543;C1561540;C1561540;C1561540;C1561543;C1561543;C1550472;C1561538;C0042789;C2698833;C2698833;C0439775;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0000589;C0000589;C0233492;C3540799;C0745348;C0332534;C4699604;C3843399;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1512346;C0655359;C1555709;C1552839;C1101725;C0056685;C1553756;C4086490;C0031809;C0033621;C0087130;C0151576,1086.0,211875.0,0,196.0,98.0,0.021432828368019817,0.018004915995885818

NCT02097381,Study of Recovery of Intestinal CD4+ and Th17 T Cells in HIV-infected Individuals on Short-term Antiretroviral Therapy,"HIV infection is associated with a state of chronic, generalized immune activation that has      been shown in many studies to be a key predictor of progression to AIDS. The molecular,      cellular, and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the HIV-associated immune activation      are complex and still poorly studied. There is, however, growing consensus that both viral      and host factors contribute to this phenotype, with emphasis on the role played by the      mucosal immune dysfunction (and consequent microbial translocation). Moreover if it is known      that in HIV-infected individuals, a severe depletion of intestinal cluster of differentiation      4 (CD4+) T-cells, is associated with loss of epithelium integrity, microbial translocation      and systemic immune activation, the kinetics of intestinal CD4+ T-cell reconstitution under      combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) remains poorly understood.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ), also known as bactrim, is a common antibiotic and      used as prophylaxis for OIs. For countries with high prevalence of HIV and limited health      infrastructure, the WHO endorses universal TMP/SMZ for all HIV-infected individuals.

NCT04246983,Point-of Care Ultrasound for Patients With HIV,"~     Rationale: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is increasingly used by various specialists in~     the Netherlands, but its role in managing patients with HIV is unclear. In settings endemic~     for tuberculosis, Fast Assessment with Sonography for HIV/Tuberculosis (FASH) has proven its~     value to detect extrapulmonary tuberculosis in patients with HIV. However, there is no data~     to support POCUS for patients with HIV in resource affluent settings.~      Objective: The investigators aim to determine the feasibility and diagnostic value of POCUS~     in detecting opportunistic disease in HIV patients with advanced disease stages in the~     Netherlands.~      Study design: The investigators will perform a prospective observational pilot study.~      Study population: The investigators will include new adult patients with HIV presenting with~     a cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T-cell count below 350 cells/mm3, and all adult HIV~     patients requiring admission to hospital. Intervention (if applicable): The investigators~     will perform a focused ultrasound examination including FASH, and ultrasound of the lung,~     liver and kidneys. In case of positive findings additional examinations will be undertaken to~     determine the underlying pathology and/or treatment started as indicated. In case of negative~     findings, patients will be followed for 12 months to observe for (possibly missed)~     opportunistic infections.~      Main study parameters/endpoints: Our primary outcomes include acceptability of POCUS by~     patients, interobserver variation in interpretation of POCUS images, and number of diagnosed~     AIDS and non-AIDS related problems. Secondary outcomes include sensitivity and specificity,~     negative predictive value and positive predictive value of our POCUS protocol. In addition,~     incidence rates of opportunistic infections will be compared to a historical matched control~     group.~      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group~     relatedness: The ultrasound examination is painless and without risk to the participants.

NCT00027352,A Comparison of Two Ways to Manage Anti-HIV Treatment (The SMART Study),"~     The purpose of this study is to compare two ways of using anti-HIV drugs to help health care~     providers and patients decide how to best use anti-HIV treatments over many years. Many~     health care providers now treat patients with daily drugs to keep the viral load as low as~     possible. This approach helps patients with CD4 counts less than 200-250 cells/mm3 live~     longer without serious diseases. But it is not known if this is the best way to treat~     patients with higher CD4 counts. There is information suggesting that these patients may be~     able to wait to use anti-HIV drugs while CD4 counts are above 250 cells/mm3. Because this~     study will be carried out over several years, it will provide information on the long-term~     advantages and disadvantages of these two treatment strategies.~   ",C0376495,C0332149;C3687832;C3687832;C3687832;C0012634;C0376495;C2598115;C0746919,0.0,0.0,-1,2619.0,87.3,0.011104958055813902,0.008812438371488828

NCT02850276,"Autonomic Neuropathy, GI Motility, and Inflammation in HIV","~     The purpose of this study is to explore a possible link between the autonomic nervous system~     and immune function in patients with HIV. Sometimes HIV can cause these nerves to function~     abnormally, this is called HIV-associated autonomic neuropathy (HIV-AN). HIV-AN is a~     condition that is different from person to person. In some people it causes no symptoms and~     is not harmful, in others it may cause symptoms such as dizziness or lightheadedness, nausea,~     vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or problems urinating. Most people with HIV-AN don't know~     that they have it. One of the important nerves in the autonomic nervous system is the vagus~     nerve. Abnormal function of the vagus nerve may cause stomach and intestinal slowing, which~     could lead to an overgrowth of bacteria. The body senses these bacteria and tries to fight~     them, leading to inflammation.~      In this study the researchers will test whether abnormal function of the vagus nerve in HIV~     is associated with stomach slowing and overgrowth of bacteria, and if a drug called~     pyridostigmine can help.~   ",C0021368;C0442874;C1510470,C0220870;C0009806;C0442874;C0012833;C0332149;C1457887;C1457887;C0042963;C0011991;C0205161;C0205161;C0038351;C0038351;C0033213;C0205161,11.0,105.0,-1,227.0,227.0,0.015527950310558992,0.004419574887346673
